<h2><small>TO MADAME</small><br />

ELISABETH SAINTE-MARIE PERRIN, <i>N&Eacute;E</i> BAZIN</h2>


<p>To inscribe your name upon this volume, dear Madame, is to
recall delightful memories of my year in France. Your sympathy
encouraged me in the adventurous choice of a subject so large and
simple for a course of lectures at the Sorbonne. While they were
in the making, you acted as an audience of one, in the long music-room
at Hostel and in the forest of St. Gervais, and gave gentle
counsels of wisdom in regard to the points likely to interest and
retain a larger audience of Parisians in the <i>Amphith&eacute;&acirc;tre Richelieu</i>.
Then, the university adventure being ended without mishap, your
skill as a translator admirably clothed the lectures in your own
lucid language, and sent them out to help a little in strengthening
the ties of friendship between France and America. Grateful for
all the charming hospitality of your country, which made my year
happy and, I hope, not unfruitful, I dedicate to you this book on
the Spirit of America, because you have done so much to make me
understand, appreciate, and admire the true Spirit of France.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This book contains the first seven of a series of
twenty-six <i>conf&eacute;rences</i>, given in the winter of 1908-1909,
on the Hyde Foundation, at the University
of Paris, and repeated in part at other universities
of France. They were delivered in English, and
afterward translated into French and published
under the title of <i>Le G&eacute;nie de l&rsquo;Am&eacute;rique</i>. In
making this American edition it has not seemed
worth while to attempt to disguise the fact that
these chapters were prepared as lectures to be
given to a French audience, and that their purpose,
in accordance with the generous design of the
founder of the chair, was to promote an intelligent
sympathy between France and the United States.
If the book finds readers among my countrymen,
I beg them, as they read, to remember its origin.
Perhaps it may have an interest of its own, as a
report, made in Paris, of the things that seem vital,
significant, and creative in the life and character
of the American people.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>There is an ancient amity between France and
America, which is recorded in golden letters in the
chronicles of human liberty. In one of the crowded
squares of New York there stands a statue of a young
nobleman, slender, elegant, and brave, springing forward
to offer his sword to the cause of freedom. The
name under that figure is La Fayette. In one of the
broad avenues of Paris there stands a statue of a
plain gentleman, grave, powerful, earnest, sitting his
horse like a victor and lifting high his sword to salute
the star of France. The name under that figure is
Washington.</p>

<p>It is well that in both lands such a friendship between
two great peoples should be</p>

<p class="poem">&ldquo;Immortalized by art&rsquo;s immortal praise.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noidt">It is better still that it should be warmed and strengthened
by present efforts for the common good: that
the world should see the two great republics standing
together for justice and fair play at Algeciras, working
together for the world&rsquo;s peace at the Congress of
the Hague.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>

<p>But in order that a friendship like this should
really continue and increase, there must be something
more than a sentimental sympathy. There must be
a mutual comprehension, a real understanding, between
the two peoples. Romantic love, the little
<i>Amor</i> with the bow and arrows, may be as blind as
the painters and novelists represent him. But true
friendship, the strong god <i>Amicitia</i>, is open-eyed and
clear-sighted. So long as Frenchmen insist upon
looking at America merely as the country of the Sky-scraper
and the Almighty Dollar, so long as Americans
insist upon regarding France merely as the home
of the Yellow Novel and the Everlasting Dance, so
long will it be difficult for the ancient amity between
these two countries to expand and deepen into a
true and vital concord.</p>

<p>France and America must know each other better.
They must learn to look each into the other&rsquo;s mind,
to read each the other&rsquo;s heart. They must recognize
each other less by their foibles and more by their
faiths, less by the factors of national weakness and
more by the elements of national strength. Then,
indeed, I hope and believe they will be good and
faithful friends.</p>

<p>It is to promote this serious and noble purpose
that an American gentleman, Mr. James Hazen
Hyde, has founded two chairs, one at the University
of Paris, and one at Harvard University, for an an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>nual
interchange of professors, (and possibly of
ideas,) between France and America. Through
this generous arrangement we have had the benefit
of hearing, in the United States, MM. Doumic, Rod,
de R&eacute;gnier, Gaston Deschamps, Hugues Le Roux,
Mabilleau, Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu, Millet, Le Braz,
Tardieu, and the Vicomte d&rsquo;Avenel. On the same
basis Messrs. Barrett Wendell, Santayana, Coolidge,
and Baker have spoken at the Sorbonne and at the
other French Universities. This year Harvard has
called me from the chair of English Literature at
Princeton University, and the authorities of the
Sorbonne have graciously accorded me the hospitality
of this <i>Amphith&eacute;&acirc;tre Richelieu</i>, to take my
small part in this international mission.</p>

<p>Do you ask for my credentials as an ambassador?
Let me omit such formalities as academic degrees,
professorships, and doctorates, and present my claims
in more simple and humble form. A family residence
of two hundred and fifty years in America, whither my
ancestors came from Holland in 1652; a working life
of thirty years which has taken me among all sorts
and conditions of men, in almost all the states of the
Union from Maine to Florida and from New York to
California; a personal acquaintance with all the
Presidents except one since Lincoln; a friendship
with many woodsmen, hunters, and fishermen in
the forests where I spend the summers; an entire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
independence of any kind of political, ecclesiastical,
or academic partisanship; and some familiarity with
American literature, its origins, and its historical relations,&mdash;these
are all the claims that I can make to
your attention. They are small enough, to be sure,
but such as they are you may find in them a partial
explanation of the course which these lectures are to
take.</p>

<p>You will understand that if I have chosen a subject
which is not strictly academic, it is because the best
part of my life has been spent out of doors among
men. You will perceive that my failure to speak of
Boston as the centre of the United States may have
some connection with the accident that I am not a
Bostonian. You will account for the absence of a
suggestion that any one political party is the only
hope of the Republic by the fact that I am not a politician.
You will detect in my attitude towards literature
the na&iuml;ve conviction that it is not merely an art
existing for art&rsquo;s sake, but an expression of the inner
life and a factor in the moral character. Finally, you
will conclude, with your French logicality of mind,
that I must be an obstinate idealist, because I am
going to venture to lecture to you on <i>The Spirit of
America</i>. That is as much as to say that I believe
man is led by an inner light, and that the ideals,
moral convictions, and vital principles of a people
are the most important factors in their history.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span></p>

<p>All these things are true. They cannot be denied
or concealed. I would willingly confess them and a
hundred more, if I might contribute but a little
towards the purpose of these lectures: to help some
of the people of France to understand more truly
the real people of America,&mdash;a people of idealists
engaged in a great practical task.</p>

<h2>I<br />

THE SOUL OF A PEOPLE</h2>


<p>There is a proverb which affirms that in order
to know a man you have only to travel with him for
a week. Almost all of us have had experiences,
sometimes happy and sometimes the reverse, which
seem to confirm this saying.</p>

<p>A journey in common is a sort of involuntary
confessional. There is a certain excitement, a
confusion and quickening of perceptions and sensations,
in the adventures, the sudden changes,
the new and striking scenes of travel. The bonds
of habit are loosened. Impulses of pleasure and
of displeasure, suddenly felt, make themselves surprisingly
visible. Wishes and appetites and prejudices
which are usually dressed in a costume of
words so conventional as to amount to a disguise
now appear unmasked, and often in very scanty
costume, as if they had been suddenly called from
their beds by an alarm of fire on a steamboat, or, to
use a more agreeable figure, by the announcement
in a hotel on the Righi of approaching sunrise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>There is another thing which plays, perhaps, a
part in this power of travel to make swift disclosures.
I mean the vague sense of release from duties and restraints
which comes to one who is away from home.
Much of the outward form of our daily conduct is
regulated by the structure and operation of the
social machinery in which we quite inevitably find
our place. But when all this is left behind, when
a man no longer feels the pressure of the neighbouring
wheels, the constraint of the driving-belt which
makes them all move together, nor the restraint of
the common task to which the collective force of all
is applied, he is &ldquo;outside of the machine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ordinary sight-seeing, uncommercial traveller&mdash;the
tourist, the globe-trotter&mdash;is not usually a
person who thinks much of his own responsibilities,
however conscious he may be of his own importance.
His favourite proverb is, &ldquo;When you are in
Rome, do as the Romans do.&rdquo; But in the application
of the proverb, he does not always inquire
whether the particular thing which he is invited to
do is done by the particular kind of Roman that
he would like to be, if he lived in Rome, or by some
other kind of Roman quite different, even contrary.
He is liberated. He is unaccountable. He is a
butterfly visiting a strange garden. He has only to
enjoy himself according to his caprice and to accept
the invitations of the flowers which please him most.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>This feeling of irresponsibility in travel corresponds
somewhat to the effect of wine. The tongue
is loosened. Unexpected qualities and inclinations
are unconsciously confessed. A new man, hitherto
unknown, appears upon the scene. And this new
man often seems more natural, more spontaneous,
more vivid, than our old acquaintance. &ldquo;At last,&rdquo;
we say to ourselves, &ldquo;we know the true inwardness,
the real reality of this fellow. He is not acting a
part now. He is coming to the surface. We see
what a bad fellow, or what a good fellow, he is. <i>In
vino et in viatore veritas!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>But is it quite correct, after all, this first impression
that travel is the great revealer of character?
Is it the essential truth, the fundamental truth, <i>la
vraie verit&eacute;</i>, that we discover through this glass?
Or is it, rather, a novel aspect of facts which are real
enough, indeed, but not fundamental,&mdash;an aspect
so novel that it presents itself as more important
than it really is? To put the question in brief,
and in a practical form, is a railway train the place
to study character, or is it only a place to observe
characteristics?</p>

<p>There is, of course, a great deal of complicated
and quarrelsome psychology involved in this seeming
simple question,&mdash;for example, the point at
issue between the determinists and libertarians, the
philosophers of the unconscious and the philoso<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>phers
of the ideal,&mdash;all of which I will prudently
pass by, in order to make a very practical and
common-sense observation.</p>

<p>Ordinary travel usually obscures and confuses
quite as much as it reveals in the character of the
traveller. His excitement, his moral detachment,
his intellectual dislocation, unless he is a person of
extraordinary firmness and poise, are apt to make
him lose himself much more than they help him
to find himself. In these strange and transient
experiences his action lacks meaning and relation.
He is carried away. He is uprooted. He is swept
along by the current of external novelty. This
may be good for him or bad for him. I do not ask
this question. I am not moralizing. I am observing.
The point is that under these conditions I do
not see the real man more clearly, but less clearly.
To paraphrase a Greek saying, I wish not to study
Philip when he is a little exhilarated, but Philip
when he is sober: not when he is at a Persian
banquet, but when he is with his Macedonians.</p>

<p>Moreover, if I mistake not, the native environment,
the chosen or accepted task, the definite place
in the great world-work, is part of the man himself.
There are no human atoms. Relation is inseparable
from quality. Absolute isolation would be invisibility.
Displacement is deformity. You remember
what Emerson says in his poem, <i>Each and All</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;The delicate shells lay on the shore:<br />
The bubbles of the latest wave<br />
Fresh pearls to their enamel gave,<br />
And the bellowing of the savage sea<br />
Greeted their safe escape to me.<br />
I wiped away the weeds and foam,<br />
I fetched my sea-born treasures home,<br />
But the poor, unsightly, noisome things<br />
Had left their beauty on the shore<br />
With the sun and the sand and the wild uproar.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>So I would see my man where he belongs, in the
midst of the things which have produced him and
which he has helped to produce. I would understand
something of his relation to them. I would
watch him at his work, the daily labour which not
only earns his living but also moulds and forms his
life. I would see how he takes hold of it, with
reluctance or with alacrity, and how he regards it,
with honour or with contempt. I would consider
the way in which he uses its tangible results; to
what purpose he applies them; for what objects he
spends the fruit of his toil; what kind of bread
he buys with the sweat of his brow or his brain.
I would trace in his environment the influence of
those who have gone before him. I would read
the secrets of his heart in the uncompleted projects
which he forms for those who are to come after
him. In short, I would see the roots from which
he springs, and the hopes in which his heart flowers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, and thus only, the real man, the entire man,
would become more clear to me. He might appear
more or less admirable. I might like him more, or
less. That would make no difference. The one
thing that is sure is that I should know him better.
I should know the soul of the man.</p>

<p>If this is true, then, of the individual, how much
more is it true of a nation, a people? The inward
life, the real life, the animating and formative life
of a people is infinitely difficult to discern and
understand.</p>

<p>There are a hundred concourses of travel in
modern Europe where you may watch &ldquo;the passing
show&rdquo; of all nations with vast amusement,&mdash;on
the <i>Champs-Elys&eacute;es</i> in May or June, in the park
of <i>Aix-les-Bains</i> in midsummer, at the Italian
Lakes in autumn, in the colonnade of Shepherd&rsquo;s
Hotel at Cairo in January or February, on the
Pincian Hill at Rome in March or April. Take
your seats, ladies and gentlemen, at this continuous
performance, this international <i>vaudeville</i>, and observe
British habits, French manners, German customs,
American eccentricities, whatever interests
you in the varied entertainment. But do not
imagine that in this way you will learn to know
the national personality of England, or France, or
Germany, or America. That is something which
is never exported.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Some drop of tincture or extract of it, indeed,
may pass from one land to another in a distinct
and concentrated individuality, as when a Lafayette
comes to America, or a Franklin to France.
Some partial portrait and imperfect image of it,
indeed, may be produced in literature. And there
the reader who is wise enough to separate the head-dress
from the head, and to discern the figure beneath
the costume, may trace at least some features
of the real life represented and expressed in poem
or romance, in essay or discourse. But even this
literature, in order to be vitally understood, must be
interpreted in relation to the life of the men who
have produced it and the men for whom it was
produced.</p>

<p>Authors are not algebraic quantities,&mdash;<i>X</i>, <i>Y</i>, <i>Z</i>,
&amp;c. They express spiritual actions and reactions
in the midst of a given environment. What
they write is in one sense a work of art, and therefore
to be judged accurately by the laws of that art.
But when this judgment is made, when the book
has been assigned its rank according to its substance,
its structure, its style, there still remains another
point of view from which it is to be considered.
The book is a document of life. It is the embodiment
of a spiritual protest, perhaps; or it is the
unconscious confession of an intellectual ambition;
or it is an appeal to some popular sentiment; or it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
is the expression of the craving for some particular
form of beauty or joy; or it is a tribute to some
personal or social excellence; or it is the record of
some vision of perfection seen in</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;The light that never was, on sea or land,<br />
The consecration, and the poet&rsquo;s dream.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">In every case, it is something that comes out of
a heritage of ideals and adds to them.</p>

<p>The possessor of this heritage is the soul of a
people. This soul of a people lives at home.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that America has been imperfectly
understood, and in some respects positively
misunderstood in Europe. The American tourists,
who have been numerous (and noticeable) on all
the European highways of pleasure and byways of
curiosity during the last forty years, have made a
vivid impression on the people of the countries which
they have visited. They are recognized. They are
remembered. It is not necessary to inquire whether
this recognition contains more of admiration or of
astonishment, whether the forms which it often takes
are flattering or the reverse. On this point I am
sufficiently American myself to be largely indifferent.
But the point on which I feel strongly is that
the popular impression of America which is derived
only or chiefly from the observation of American
travellers is, and must be, deficient, superficial, and
in many ways misleading.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>If this crowd of American travellers were a hundred
times as numerous, it would still fail to be
representative, it would still be unable to reveal the
Spirit of America, just because it is composed of
travellers.</p>

<p>I grant you that it includes many, perhaps almost
all, of the different types and varieties of Americans,
good, bad, and mediocre. You will find in this
crowd some very simple people and some very complicated
people; country folk and city folk; strenuous
souls who come to seek culture and relaxed
souls who come to spend money; millionnaires and
school-teachers, saloon-keepers and university professors;
men of the East and men of the West;
Yankees, Knickerbockers, Hoosiers, Cavaliers, and
Cowboys. Surely, you say, from such a large collection
of samples one ought to be able to form an
adequate judgment of the stuff.</p>

<p>But no; on the contrary, the larger the collection
of samples, seen under the detaching and exaggerating
conditions of travel, the more confused and
the less sane and penetrating your impression will
be, unless by some other means you have obtained
an idea of the vital origin, the true relation, the
common inheritance, and the national unity of these
strange and diverse travellers who come from beyond
the sea.</p>

<p>Understand, I do not mean to say that European<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
scholars and critics have not studied American
affairs and institutions to advantage and thrown a
clear light of intelligence, of sympathy, of criticism,
upon the history and life of the United States. A
philosophical study like that of Tocqueville, a political
study like that of Mr. James Bryce, a series
of acute social observations like those of M. Paul
Bourget, M. Andr&eacute; Tardieu, M. Paul Boutmy,
M. Weiller, an industrial study like that of M.
d&rsquo;Avenel, or a religious study like that of the Abb&eacute;
Klein,&mdash;these are of great value. But they are
quite apart, quite different, from the popular impression
of America in Europe, an impression which
is, and perhaps to some extent must naturally be,
based upon the observations of Americans <i>en voyage</i>,
and which by some strange hypnotism sometimes
imposes itself for a while upon the American travellers
themselves.</p>

<p>I call this the international postal-card view of
America. It is often amusing, occasionally irritating,
and almost always confusing. It has flashes of
truth in it. It renders certain details with the accuracy
of a kodak. But, like a picture made by
the kodak, it has a deficient perspective and no
atmosphere. The details do not fit together. They
are irrelevant. They are often contradictory.</p>

<p>For example, you will hear statements made about
America like the following:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&lsquo;The Americans worship the Almighty Dollar more than
the English revere the Ponderous Pound or the French adore
<i>les beaux &eacute;cus sonnants</i>. <i>Per contra</i>, the Americans are foolish
spendthrifts who have no sense of the real value of money.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&lsquo;America is a country without a social order. It is a
house of one story, without partitions, in which all the inhabitants
are on a level. <i>Per contra</i>, America is the place
where class distinctions are most sharply drawn, and where
the rich are most widely and irreconcilably separated from the
poor.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&lsquo;The United States is a definite experiment in political
theory, which was begun in 1776, and which has succeeded
because of its philosophical truth and logical consistency.
<i>Per contra</i>, the United States is an accident, a nation born
of circumstances and held together by good fortune, without
real unity or firm foundation.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&lsquo;The American race is a new creation, aboriginal, autochthonous,
which ought to express itself in totally new and
hitherto unheard-of forms of art and literature. <i>Per contra</i>,
there is no American race, only a vast and absurd <i>m&eacute;lange</i> of
incongruous elements, cast off from Europe by various political
convulsions, and combined by the pressure of events, not
into a people, but into a mere population, which can never
have a literature or an art of its own.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&lsquo;America is a lawless land, where every one does what he
likes and pays no attention to the opinion of his neighbour.
<i>Per contra</i>, America is a land of prejudice, of interference, of
restriction, where personal liberty is constantly invaded by the
tyranny of narrow ideas and traditions, embodied in ridiculous
laws which tell a man how many hours a day he may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
work, what he may drink, how he may amuse himself on
Sunday, and how fast he may drive his automobile.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&lsquo;Finally, America is the home of materialism, a land of
crude, practical worldliness, unimaginative, irreverent, without
religion. But <i>per contra</i>, America is the last refuge of superstition,
of religious enthusiasm, of unenlightened devotion,
even of antique bigotry, a land of spiritual dreamers and
fanatics, who, as Brillat-Savarin said, have &ldquo;forty religions
and only one sauce.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>Have I sharpened these contrasts and contradictions
a little? Have I overaccented the inconsistencies
in this picture postal-card view of America?</p>

<p>Perhaps so. Yet it is impossible to deny that the
main features of this incoherent view are familiar.
We see the reflection of them in the singular choice
and presentation of the rare items of American
news which find their way into the columns of European
newspapers. We recognize them in the talk
of the street and of the <i>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>.</p>

<p>I remember very well the gravity and earnestness
with which a learned German asked me, some years
ago, whether, if he went to America, it would be a
serious disadvantage to him in the first social circles
to eat with his knife at the dinner-table. He was
much relieved by my assurance that no one would
take notice of it.</p>

<p>I recall also the charming na&iuml;vet&eacute; with which an
English lady inquired, &ldquo;Have you any good writers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
in the States?&rdquo; The answer was: &ldquo;None to speak
of. We import most of our literature from Australia,
by way of the Cape of Good Hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes we are asked whether we do not find
it a great disadvantage to have no language of our
own; or whether the justices of the Supreme Court
are usually persons of good education; or whether
we often meet Buffalo Bill in New York society;
or whether Shakespeare or Bernard Shaw is most
read in the States. To such inquiries we try to
return polite answers, although our despair of conveying
the truth sometimes leads us to clothe it in a
humorous disguise.</p>

<p>But these are minor matters. It is when we are
seriously interrogated about the prospect of a
hereditary nobility in America, created from the
descendants of railway princes, oil magnates, and
iron dukes; or when we are questioned as to the
probability that the next President, or the one after
the next, may assume an imperial state and crown,
or perhaps that he may abolish the Constitution and
establish communism; or when we are asked whether
the Germans, or the Irish, or the Scandinavians, or
the Jews are going to dominate the United States
in the twentieth century; or when we are told that
the industrial and commercial forces which created
the republic are no longer co&ouml;perant but divisive,
and that the nation must inevitably split into several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
fragments, more or less hostile, but certainly rival;
it is when such questions are gravely asked, that we
begin to feel that there are some grave misconceptions,
or at least that there is something important
lacking, in the current notion of how America came
into being and what America really is.</p>

<p>I believe that the thing which is lacking is the
perception of the Spirit of America as the creative
force, the controlling power, the characteristic element
of the United States.</p>

<p>The republic is not an accident, happy or otherwise.
It is not a fortuitous concourse of emigrants.
It is not the logical demonstration of an abstract
theory of government. It is the development of a
life,&mdash;an inward life of ideals, sentiments, ruling
passions, embodying itself in an outward life of
forms, customs, institutions, relations,&mdash;a process
as vital, as spontaneous, as inevitable, as the growth
of a child into a man. The soul of a people has
made the American nation.</p>

<p>It is of this Spirit of America, in the past and in
the present, and of some of its expressions, that I
would speak in these conferences. I speak of it in
the past because I believe that we must know something
of its origins, its early manifestations, its experiences,
and its conflicts in order to understand
what it truly signifies.</p>

<p>The spirit of a people, like the spirit of a man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
is influenced by heredity. But this heredity is not
merely physical, it is spiritual. There is a transmission
of qualities through the soul as well as
through the flesh. There is an intellectual paternity.
There is a kinship of the mind as well as of
the body. The soul of the people in America to-day
is the lineal descendant of the soul of the people
which made America in the beginning.</p>

<p>Just at what moment of time this soul came into
being, I do not know. Some theologians teach that
there is a certain point at which the hidden physical
life of an infant receives a <i>donum</i> of spiritual life
which makes it a person, a human being. I do not
imagine that we can fix any such point in the conception
and gestation of a people. Certainly it
would be difficult to select any date of which we
could say with assurance, &ldquo;On that day, in that
year, the exiles of England, of Scotland, of Holland,
of France, of Germany, on the shores of the new
world, became one folk, into which the Spirit of
America entered.&rdquo; But just as certainly it is clear
that the mysterious event came to pass. And beyond
a doubt the time of its occurrence was long
before the traditional birthday of the republic, the
4th of July, 1776.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence did not create&mdash;it
did not even pretend to create&mdash;a new state
of things. It simply recognized a state of things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
already existing. It declared &ldquo;that these United
Colonies <i>are</i>, and of right ought to be, free and independent
States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men who framed this declaration were not
ignorant, nor careless in the use of words. When
practically the same men were called, a few years
later, to frame a constitution for the United States,
they employed quite different language: &ldquo;We, the
people of the United States, ... do ordain and
establish this Constitution.&rdquo; That is the language
of creation. It assumes to bring into being something
which did not previously exist. But the language
of the Declaration of Independence is the
language of recognition. It sets forth clearly a fact
which has already come to pass, but which has
hitherto been ignored, neglected or denied.</p>

<p>What was that fact? Nothing else than the
existence of a new people, separate, distinct, independent,
in the thirteen American colonies. At
what moment in the troubled seventeenth century,
age of European revolt and conflict, the spirit of
liberty brooding upon the immense wilderness of
the New World, engendered this new life, we cannot
tell. At what moment in the philosophical
eighteenth century, age of reason and reflection, this
new life began to be self-conscious and to feel its
way toward an organic unity of powers and efforts,
we cannot precisely determine. But the thing that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
is clear and significant is that independence existed
before it was declared. The soul of the American
people was already living and conscious before the
history of the United States began.</p>

<p>I call this fact significant, immensely significant,
because it marks not merely a verbal distinction
but an essential difference, a difference which is
vital to the true comprehension of the American
spirit in the past and in the present.</p>

<p>A nation brought to birth by an act of violence,
if such a thing be possible,&mdash;or let us rather say,
a nation achieving liberty by a sharp and sudden
break with its own past and a complete overturning
of its own traditions, will naturally carry with it
the marks of such an origin. It will be inclined to
extreme measures and methods. It will be particularly
liable to counter-revolutions. It will often
vibrate between radicalism and reactionism.</p>

<p>But a nation &ldquo;conceived in liberty,&rdquo; to use Lincoln&rsquo;s
glorious phrase, and pursuing its natural aims,
not by the method of swift and forcible change, but
by the method of normal and steady development,
will be likely to have another temperament and a
different history. It will at least endeavour to
practice moderation, prudence, patience. It will
try new experiments slowly. It will advance, not
indeed without interruption, but with a large and
tranquil confidence that its security and progress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
are in accordance with the course of nature and the
eternal laws of right reason.</p>

<p>Now this is true in the main of the United States.
And the reason for this large and tranquil confidence,
at which Europeans sometimes smile because it
looks like bravado, and for this essentially conservative
temper, at which Europeans sometimes
wonder because it seems unsuitable to a democracy,&mdash;the
reason, I think, is to be found in the history
of the soul of the people.</p>

<p>The American Revolution, to speak accurately
and philosophically, was not a revolution at all. It
was a resistance.</p>

<p>The Americans did not propose to conquer new
rights and privileges, but to defend old ones.</p>

<p>The claim of Washington and Adams and Franklin
and Jefferson and Jay and Schuyler and Witherspoon
was that the kings of England had established
the colonies in certain liberties which the
Parliament was endeavouring to take away. These
liberties, the Americans asserted, belonged to them
not only by natural right, but also by precedent
and ancient tradition. The colonists claimed that
the proposed reorganization of the colonies, which
was undertaken by the British Parliament in
1763, was an interruption of their history and a
change in the established conditions of their life.
They were unwilling to submit to it. They united<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and armed to prevent it. They took the position
of men who were defending their inheritance of
self-government against a war of subjugation
disguised as a new scheme of imperial legislation.</p>

<p>Whether they were right or wrong in making
this claim, whether the arguments by which they
supported it were sound or sophistical, we need not
now consider. For the present, the point is that
the claim was made, and that the making of it is
one of the earliest and clearest revelations of the
Spirit of America.</p>

<p>No doubt in that struggle of defence which we
are wont to call, for want of a better name, the
Revolution, the colonists were carried by the irresistible
force of events far beyond this position.
The privilege of self-government which they claimed,
the principle of &ldquo;no taxation without representation,&rdquo;
appeared to them, at last, defensible and practicable
only on the condition of absolute separation
from Great Britain. This separation implied sovereignty.
This sovereignty demanded union. This
union, by the logic of events, took the form of a
republic. This republic continues to exist and to
develop along the normal lines of its own nature,
because it is still animated and controlled by the
same Spirit of America which brought it into being
to embody the soul of the people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>I am quite sure that there are few, even among
Americans, who appreciate the literal truth and the
full meaning of this last statement. It is common to
assume that the Spirit of 1776 is an affair of the
past; that the native American stock is swallowed
up and lost in our mixed population; and that the
new United States, beginning, let us say, at the close
of the Civil War, is now controlled and guided by
forces which have come to it from without. This is
not true even physically, much less is it true intellectually
and morally.</p>

<p>The blended strains of blood which made the
American people in the beginning are still the dominant
factors in the American people of to-day.
Men of distinction in science, art, and statesmanship
have come from abroad to cast their fortunes
in with the republic,&mdash;men like Gallatin and Agassiz
and Guyot and Lieber and McCosh and Carl Schurz,&mdash;and
their presence has been welcomed, their
service received with honour. Of the total population
of the United States in 1900 more than 34
per cent were of foreign birth or parentage. But
the native stock has led and still leads America.</p>

<p>There is a popular cyclop&aelig;dia of names, called
<i>Who&rsquo;s Who in America</i>, which contains brief biographies
of some 16,395 living persons, who are supposed
to be more or less distinguished, in one way
or another, in the various regions in which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
live. It includes the representatives of foreign
governments in the United States, and some foreign
authors and business men. It is not necessary to
imagine that all who are admitted to this quasi-golden
book of &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s-who-dom&rdquo; are really great
or widely famous. There are perhaps many of
whom we might inquire, Which is who, and why is
he somewhat? But, after all, the book includes
most of the successful lawyers, doctors, merchants,
bankers, preachers, politicians, authors, artists, and
teachers,&mdash;the people who are most influential in
their local communities and best known to their
fellow-citizens. The noteworthy fact is that 86.07
per cent are native Americans. I think that a careful
examination of the record would show that a
very large majority have at least three generations
of American ancestry on one side or the other of
the family.</p>

<p>Of the men elected to the presidency of the
United States there has been only one whose ancestors
did not belong to America before the Revolution,&mdash;James
Buchanan, whose father was a Scotch-Irish
preacher who came to the New World in 1783.
All but four of the Presidents of the United States
could trace their line back to Americans of the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>But it is not upon these striking facts of physical
heredity that I would rest my idea of an American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
people, distinct and continuous, beginning a conscious
life at some time antecedent to 1764 and
still guiding the development of the United States.
I would lay far more stress upon intellectual and
spiritual heredity, that strange process of moral
generation by which the qualities of the Spirit of
America have been communicated to millions of
immigrants from all parts of the world.</p>

<p>Since 1820 about twenty-six million persons have
come to the United States from foreign lands. At
the present moment, in a population which is estimated
at about ninety millions, there are probably
between thirteen and fifteen millions who are foreign-born.
It is an immense quantity for any nation
to digest and assimilate, and it must be confessed
that there are occasional signs of local dyspepsia in
the large cities. But none the less it may be confidently
affirmed that the foreign immigration of the
past has been thoroughly transformed into American
material, and that the immigration of the present
is passing through the same process without any
alarming interruption.</p>

<p>I can take you into quarters of New York where
you might think yourself in a Russian Ghetto, or
into regions of Pennsylvania which would seem to
you like Hungarian mining towns. But if you will
come with me into the public schools, where the children
of these people of the Old World are gathered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
for education, you will find yourself in the midst
of fairly intelligent and genuinely patriotic young
Americans. They will salute the flag for you with
enthusiasm. They will sing &ldquo;Columbia&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Star Spangled Banner&rdquo; with more vigour than harmony.
They will declaim Webster&rsquo;s apostrophe to
the Union, or cry with Patrick Henry, &ldquo;Give me
liberty or give me death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What is more, they will really feel, in some dim
but none the less vital way, the ideals for which
these symbols stand. Give them time, and their
inward allegiance will become clearer, they will
begin to perceive how and why they are Americans.
They will be among those wise children
who know their own spiritual fathers.</p>

<p>Last June it fell to my lot to deliver the commencement
address at the College of the City of
New York, a free institution which is the crown of
the public school system of the city. Only a very
small proportion of the scholars had names that you
could call American, or even Anglo-Saxon. They
were French and German, Polish and Italian, Russian
and Hebrew. Yet as I spoke on the subject
of citizenship, suggested by the recent death of that
great American, ex-President Grover Cleveland, the
response was intelligent, immediate, unanimous, and
eager. There was not one of that crowd of young
men who would have denied or surrendered his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
right to trace his patriotic ancestry, his inherited
share in the Spirit of America, back to Lincoln and
Webster, Madison and Jefferson, Franklin and
Washington.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the proposition to which I dedicate
these conferences.</p>

<p>There is now, and there has been since before
the Revolution, a Spirit of America, the soul of a
people, and it is this which has made the United
States and which still animates and controls them.</p>

<p>I shall try to distinguish and describe a few, four
or five of the essential features, qualities, ideals,&mdash;call
them what you will,&mdash;the main elements of
that spirit as I understand it. I shall also speak
of two or three other traits, matters of temperament,
perhaps, more than of character, which seem to me
distinctly American. Then because I am neither a
politician nor a jurist, I shall pass from the important
field of civil government and national institutions,
to consider some of the ways in which
this soul of the American people has expressed
itself in education and in social effort and in literature.</p>

<p>In following this course I venture to hope that it
may be possible to correct, or at least to modify,
some of the inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the
popular view of America which prevails in some
quarters of Europe. Perhaps I may be able to sug<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>gest,
even to Americans, some of the real sources of
our national unity and strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Un Am&eacute;ricain</i>&rdquo; says Andr&eacute; Tardieu, in his
recent book, &ldquo;<i>est toujours plus proche qu&rsquo;on ne
croit d&rsquo;un contradicteur Am&eacute;ricain</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>That is what I hope to show in these lectures. I
do not propose to argue for any creed, nor to win
converts for any political theory. In these conferences
I am not a propagandist, nor a preacher, nor an
advocate. Not even a professor, strictly speaking.
Just a man from America who is trying to make you
feel the real spirit of his country, first in her life, then
in her literature. I should be glad if in the end you
might be able to modify the ancient proverb a little
and say, <i>Tout comprendre, c&rsquo;est un peu aimer</i>.</p>

SELF-RELIANCE AND THE REPUBLIC</h2>


<p>The other day I came upon a new book with a
title which seemed to take a good ideal for granted:
<i>The New American Type</i>.</p>

<p>The author began with a description of a recent
exhibition of portraits in New York, including pictures
of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth
centuries. He was impressed with the idea that
&ldquo;an astonishing change had taken place in men
and women between the time of President Washington
and President McKinley; bodies, faces,
thoughts, had all been transformed. One short
stairway from the portraits of Reynolds to those of
Sargent ushered in changes as if it had stretched
from the first Pharaoh to the last Ptolemy.&rdquo; From
this interesting text the author went on into an
acute and sparkling discussion of the different pictures
and the personalities whom they presented,
and so into an attempt to define the new type of
American character which he inferred from the
modern portraits.</p>

<p>Now it had been my good fortune, only a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
while before, to see another exhibition of pictures
which made upon my mind a directly contrary impression.
This was not a collection of paintings,
but a show of living pictures: a Twelfth Night celebration,
in costume, at the Century Club in New
York. Four or five hundred of the best-known and
most influential men in the metropolis of America
had arrayed themselves in the habiliments of various
lands and ages for an evening of fun and frolic.
There were travellers and explorers who had brought
home the robes of the Orient. There were men of
exuberant fancy who had made themselves up as
Roman senators or Spanish toreadors or Proven&ccedil;al
troubadours. But most of the costumes were English
or Dutch or French of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. The astonishing thing was
that the men who wore them might easily have been
taken for their own grandfathers or great-grandfathers.</p>

<p>There was a Puritan who might have fled from
the oppressions of Archbishop Laud, a Cavalier who
might have sought a refuge from the severities of
Cromwell&rsquo;s Parliament, a Huguenot who might
have escaped from the pressing attentions of Louis
XIV in the Dragonnades, a Dutch burgher who
might have sailed from Amsterdam in the <i>Goede
Vrouw</i>. There were soldiers of the Colonial army
and members of the Continental Congress who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
might have been painted by Copley or Stuart or
Trumbull or Peale.</p>

<p>The types of the faces were not essentially different.
There was the same strength of bony structure,
the same firmness of outline, the same expression
of self-reliance, varying from the tranquillity of
the quiet temperament to the turbulence of the
stormy temperament. They looked like men who
were able to take care of themselves, who knew
what they wanted, and who would be likely to get
it. They had the veritable air and expression of
their ancestors of one or two hundred years ago.
And yet, as a matter of fact, they were intensely
modern Americans, typical New Yorkers of the
twentieth century.</p>

<p>Reflecting upon this interesting and rather pleasant
experience, I was convinced that the author of
<i>The New American Type</i> had allowed his imagination
to run away with his judgment. No such
general and fundamental change as he describes has
really taken place. There have been modifications
and developments and degenerations, of course,
under the new conditions and influences of modern
life. There have been also great changes of fashion
and dress,&mdash;the wearing of mustaches and beards,&mdash;the
discarding of wigs and ruffles,&mdash;the sacrifice
of a somewhat fantastic elegance to a rather monotonous
comfort in the ordinary costume of men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
These things have confused and misled my ingenious
author.</p>

<p>He has been bewildered also by the alteration in
the methods of portraiture. He has mistaken a
change in the art of the painters for a change in
the character of their subjects. It is a well-known
fact that something comes into a portrait from the
place and the manner in which it is made. I have
a collection of pictures of Charles Dickens, and it
is interesting to observe how the Scotch ones make
him look a little like a Scotchman, and the London
ones make him look intensely English, and the
American ones give him a touch of Broadway in
1845, and the photographs made in Paris have an
unmistakable suggestion of the <i>Boulevards</i>. There
is a great difference between the spirit and method
of Reynolds, Hoppner, Latour, Vanloo, and those
of Sargent, Holl, Duran, Bonnat, Alexander, and
Zorn. It is this difference that helps to conceal the
essential likeness of their sitters.</p>

<p>I was intimately acquainted with Benjamin
Franklin&rsquo;s great-grandson, a surgeon in the American
navy. Put a fur cap and knee breeches on
him, and he might easily have sat for his great-grandfather&rsquo;s
portrait. In character there was a
still closer resemblance. You can see the same
faces at any banquet in New York to-day that
Rembrandt has depicted in his &ldquo;Night-Watch,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>&rdquo;
or Franz Hals in his &ldquo;Banquet of the Civic
Guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there is something which interests me even
more than this persistence of visible ancestral
features in the Americans of to-day. It is the continuance
from generation to generation of the main
lines, the essential elements, of that American character
which came into being on the Western continent.</p>

<p>It is commonly assumed that this character is
composite, that the people who inhabit America
are a mosaic, made up of fragments brought from
various lands and put together rather at haphazard
and in a curious pattern. This assumption misses
the inward verity by dwelling too much upon the
outward fact.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there were large and striking differences
between the grave and strict Puritans who
peopled the shores of Massachusetts Bay, the pleasure-loving
Cavaliers who made their tobacco plantations
in Virginia, the liberal and comfortable Hollanders
who took possession of the lands along the Hudson,
the skilful and industrious Frenchmen who came
from old Rochelle to New Rochelle, the peaceful
and prudent Quakers who followed William Penn,
the stolid Germans of the Rhine who made their
farms along the Susquehanna, the vigorous and
aggressive Scotch-Irish Presbyterians who became
the pioneers of western Pennsylvania and North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Carolina, the tolerant Catholics who fled from
English persecution to Lord Baltimore&rsquo;s Maryland.
But these outward differences of speech, of dress,
of habits, of tradition, were, after all, of less practical
consequence than the inward resemblances and
sympathies of spirit which brought these men of
different stocks together as one people.</p>

<p>They were not a composite people, but a blended
people. They became in large measure conscious
of the same aims, loyal to the same ideals, and
capable of fighting and working together as Americans
to achieve their destiny.</p>

<p>I suppose that the natural process of intermarriage
played an important part in this blending of
races. This is an affair to which the conditions of
life in a new country, on the frontiers of civilization,
are peculiarly favourable. Love flourishes when
there are no locksmiths. In a community of exiles
the inclinations of the young men towards the young
women easily overstep the barriers of language and
descent. Quite naturally the English and Scotch
were united with the Dutch and French in the holy
state of matrimony, and the mothers had as much
to do as the fathers with the character-building of
the children.</p>

<p>But apart from this natural process of combination
there were other influences at work bringing
the colonists into unity. There was the pressure of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
a common necessity&mdash;the necessity of taking care
of themselves, of making their own living in a hard,
new world. There was the pressure of a common
danger&mdash;the danger from the fierce and treacherous
savages who surrounded them and continually
threatened them with pillage and slaughter. There
was the pressure of a common discipline&mdash;the discipline
of building up an organized industry, a
civilized community in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Yet I doubt whether even these potent forces of
compression, of fusion, of metamorphosis, would
have made one people of the colonists quite so
quickly, quite so thoroughly, if it had not been for
certain affinities of spirit, certain ideals and purposes
which influenced them all, and which made
the blending easier and more complete.</p>

<p>Most of the colonists of the seventeenth century,
you will observe, were people who in one way or
another had suffered for their religious convictions,
whether they were Puritans or Catholics, Episcopalians
or Presbyterians, Quakers or Anabaptists.</p>

<p>The almost invariable effect of suffering for religion
is to deepen its power and to intensify the desire for
liberty to practise it.</p>

<p>It is true that other motives, the love of adventure,
the desire to attain prosperity in the affairs of
this world, and in some cases the wish to escape
from the consequences of misconduct or misfortune<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
in the old country, played a part in the settlement
of America. Nothing could be more absurd than
the complacent assumption that all the ancestors
from whom the &ldquo;Colonial Dames&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Sons of
the Revolution&rdquo; delight to trace their descent were
persons of distinguished character and fervent piety.</p>

<p>But the most characteristic element of the early
emigration was religious, and that not by convention
and conformity, but by conscience and conviction.
There was less difference among the various colonies
in this respect than is generally imagined. The
New Englanders, who have written most of the
American histories, have been in the way of claiming
the lion&rsquo;s share of the religious influence for the
Puritans. But while Massachusetts was a religious
colony with commercial tendencies, New Amsterdam
was a commercial colony with religious principles.</p>

<p>The Virginia parson prayed by the book, and the
Pennsylvania Quaker made silence the most important
part of his ritual, but alike on the banks
of the James and on the shores of the Delaware the
ultimate significance and value of life were interpreted
in terms of religion.</p>

<p>Now one immediate effect of such a ground-tone
of existence is to increase susceptibility and devotion
to ideals. The habit of referring constantly to
religious sanctions is one that carries with it a tendency
to intensify the whole motive power of life in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
relation to its inward conceptions of what is right
and desirable. Men growing up in such an atmosphere
may easily become fanatical, but they are not
likely to be feeble.</p>

<p>Moreover, the American colonists, by the very
conditions of natural selection which brought them
together, must have included more than the usual
proportion of strong wills, resolute and independent
characters, people who knew what they wanted to
do and were willing to accept needful risks and
hardships in order to do it. The same thing, at
least to some extent, holds good of the later immigration
into the United States.</p>

<p>Most of the immigrants must have been rich in
personal energy, clear in their conviction of what
was best for them to do. Otherwise they would
have lacked the force to break old ties, to brave
the sea, to face the loneliness and uncertainty
of life in a strange land. Discontent with their
former condition acted upon them not as a depressant
but as a tonic. The hope of something unseen,
untried, was a stimulus to which their wills reacted.
Whatever misgivings or reluctances they may have
had, upon the whole they were more attracted than
repelled by the prospect of shaping a new life for
themselves, according to their own desire, in a land
of liberty, opportunity, and difficulty.</p>

<p>We come thus to the first and most potent factor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
in the soul of the American people, <i>the spirit of self-reliance</i>.
This was the dominant and formative
factor of their early history. It was the inward
power which animated and sustained them in their
first struggles and efforts. It was deepened by
religious conviction and intensified by practical experience.
It took shape in political institutions,
declarations, constitutions. It rejected foreign guidance
and control, and fought against all external
domination. It assumed the right of self-determination,
and took for granted the power of self-development.
In the ignorant and noisy it was
aggressive, independent, cocksure, and boastful.
In the thoughtful and prudent it was grave, firm,
resolute, and inflexible. It has persisted through all
the changes and growth of two centuries, and it remains
to-day the most vital and irreducible quality
in the soul of America,&mdash;<i>the spirit of self-reliance</i>.</p>

<p>You may hear it in its popular and somewhat
vulgar form&mdash;not without a characteristic touch
of humour&mdash;in the Yankee&rsquo;s answer to the intimation
of an Englishman that if the United States
did not behave themselves well, Great Britain would
come over and whip them. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the
Yankee, &ldquo;ag&rsquo;in?&rdquo; You may hear it in deeper,
saner, wiser tones, in Lincoln&rsquo;s noble asseveration
on the battle-field of Gettysburg, that &ldquo;government
of the people, by the people, for the people <i>shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
not</i> perish from the earth.&rdquo; But however or whenever
you hear it, the thing which it utters is the
same,&mdash;the inward conviction of a people that
they have the right and the ability, and consequently
the duty, to regulate their own life, to direct their
own property, and to pursue their own happiness
according to the light which they possess.</p>

<p>It is obvious that one may give different names
to this spirit, according to the circumstances in
which it is manifested and observed. It may be
called the spirit of independence when it is shown
in opposition to forces of external control. Professor
Barrett Wendell, speaking from this chair
four years ago, said that the first ideal to take form
in the American consciousness was &ldquo;the ideal of
Liberty.&rdquo; But his well-balanced mind compelled
him immediately to limit and define this ideal as a
desire for &ldquo;the political freedom of America from
all control, from all coercion, from all interference
by any power foreign to our own American selves.&rdquo;
And what is this but self-reliance?</p>

<p>Professor M&uuml;nsterberg, in his admirable book, <i>The
Americans</i>, calls it &ldquo;the spirit of self-direction.&rdquo; He
traces its influence in the development of American
institutions and the structure of American life. He
says: &ldquo;Whoever wishes to understand the secret of
that baffling turmoil, the inner mechanism and motive
behind all the politically effective forces, must set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
out from only one point. He must appreciate the
yearning of the American heart after self-direction.
Everything else is to be understood from this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this yearning after self-<i>direction</i>, it seems to
me, is not peculiar to Americans. All men have
more or less of it by nature. All men yearn to be
their own masters, to shape their own life, to direct
their own course. The difference among men lies
in the clearness and the vigour with which they conceive
their own right and power and duty so to do.</p>

<p>Back of the temper of independence, back of the
passion for liberty, back of the yearning after self-direction,
stands the spirit of self-reliance, from
which alone they derive force and permanence. It
was this spirit that made America, and it is this
spirit that preserves the republic. Emerson has
expressed it in a sentence: &ldquo;We will walk on our
own feet; we will work with our own hands; we
will speak our own minds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that the largest influence
in the development of this spirit came from the
Puritans and Pilgrims of the New England colonies,
bred under the bracing and strengthening power of
that creed which bears the name of a great Frenchman,
John Calvin, and trained in that tremendous
sense of personal responsibility which so often carries
with it an intense feeling of personal value and
force. Yet, after all, if we look at the matter closely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
we shall see that there was no very great difference
among the colonists of various stocks and regions
in regard to their confidence in themselves and their
feeling that they both could and should direct their
own affairs.</p>

<p>The Virginians, languishing and fretting under
the first arbitrary rule of the London corporation
which controlled them with military severity, obtained
a &ldquo;Great Charter of Privileges, Orders, and
Laws&rdquo; in 1618. This gave to the little body of
settlers, about a thousand in number, the right of
electing their own legislative assembly, and thus laid
the foundation of representative government in the
New World. A little later, in 1623, fearing that the
former despotism might be renewed, the Virginia
Assembly sent a message to the king, saying, &ldquo;Rather
than be reduced to live under the like government,
we desire his Majesty that commissioners be sent
over to hang us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1624 the Virginia Company was dissolved,
and the colony passed under a royal charter, but
they still preserved and cherished the rights of
self-rule in all local affairs, and developed an extraordinary
temper of jealousy and resistance towards
the real or imagined encroachments of the
governors who were sent out by the king. In 1676
the Virginians practically rebelled against the authority
of Great Britain because they conceived that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
they were being reduced to a condition of dependence
and servitude. They felt confident that they
were able to make their own laws and to choose
their own leaders. They were distinctly not conscious
of any inferiority to their brethren in England,
and with their somewhat aristocratic tendencies
they developed a set of men like Lee and
Henry and Washington and Bland and Jefferson
and Harrison, who had more real power than any of
the royal governors.</p>

<p>In New Amsterdam, where the most liberal
policy in regard to the reception of immigrants prevailed,
but where for a long time there was little
or no semblance of popular government, the inhabitants
rebelled in 1649 against the tyranny of
the agents of the Dutch West India Company which
ruled them from across the sea,&mdash;ruled them fairly
well, upon the whole, but still denied free play to
their spirit of self-reliance. The conflicts between
the bibulous and dubious Director van Twiller and
his neighbours, between the fiery and arbitrary
William Kieft and his Eight Men, between the
valiant, obstinate, hot-tempered, and dictatorial Peter
Stuyvesant and his Nine Men, have been humorously
narrated by Washington Irving in his <i>Knickerbocker</i>.
But underneath the burlesque chronicle of
bickerings and wranglings, complaints and protests,
it is easy to see the stirrings of the sturdy spirit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
which confides in self and desires to have control
of its own affairs.</p>

<p>In 1649 the Vertoogh or Remonstrance of the
Seven Men representing the burghers of Manhattan,
Brewckelen, Amersfoort, and Pavonia was sent to
the States General of the Netherlands. It demanded
first that their High Mightinesses should turn out
the West India Company and take direct control
of New Netherland; second, that a proper municipal
government should be granted to New Amsterdam;
and third, that the boundaries of the province
should be settled by treaty with friendly powers.
This document also called attention, by way of
example, to the freedom of their neighbours in New
England, &ldquo;where neither patrouns, nor lords, nor
princes are known, but only the people.&rdquo; The
West India Company was powerful enough to resist
these demands for a time, but in 1653 New Amsterdam
was incorporated as a city.</p>

<p>Ten years later it passed under English sovereignty,
and the history of New York began. One of its
first events was the protest of certain towns on Long
Island against a tax which was laid upon them in
order to pay for the repair of the fort in New York.
They appealed to the principle of &ldquo;no taxation
without representation,&rdquo; which they claimed had
been declared alike by England and by the Dutch
republic. For nearly twenty years, however, this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
appeal and others like it were disregarded, until at
last the spirit of self-reliance became irresistible.
A petition was sent to the Duke of York declaring
that the lack of a representative assembly was &ldquo;an
intolerable grievance.&rdquo; The Duke, it is said, was
out of patience with his uneasy province, which
brought him in no revenue except complaints and
protests. &ldquo;I have a mind to sell it,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to
any one who will give me a fair price.&rdquo; &ldquo;What,&rdquo;
cried his friend William Penn, &ldquo;sell New York!
Don&rsquo;t think of such a thing. Just give it self-government,
and there will be no more trouble.&rdquo; The
Duke listened to the Quaker, and in 1683 the first
Assembly of New York was elected.</p>

<p>The charters which were granted by the Stuart
kings to the American colonies were for the most
part of an amazingly liberal character. No doubt
the royal willingness to see restless and intractable
subjects leave England had something to do with
this liberality. But the immediate effect of it was
to encourage the spirit of self-reliance. In some of
the colonies, as in Connecticut and Rhode Island, the
people elected their own governors as well as made
their own laws. When Governor Fletcher of New
York found the people of Connecticut unwilling to
comply with his demands in 1693, he wrote back
to England angrily: &ldquo;The laws of England have no
effect in this colony. They set up for a free state.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even in those colonies where the governors and
the judges were appointed by the crown, the people
were quick to suspect and bitter to resent any invasion
of their liberties or contradiction of their
will as expressed through the popular assemblies;
and these assemblies prudently retained, as a check
upon executive authority, the right of voting, and
paying, or not paying, the salaries of the governor
and other officers.</p>

<p>The policy of Great Britain in regard to the
American dependencies, while it vacillated somewhat,
was, in the main, to leave them quite independent.
Various motives may have played a part
at different times in this policy. Indifference and a
feeling of contempt may have had something to do
with it. English liberalism and republican sympathy
may have had something to do with it. A
shrewd willingness to let them prosper by their own
efforts, in their own way, in order that they might
make a better market for English manufactures,
may have had something to do with it. Thus Lord
Morley tells us: &ldquo;Walpole was content with seeing
that no trouble came from America. He left it to
the Duke of Newcastle, and the Duke left it so
much to itself that he had a closet full of despatches
from American governors, which had lain unopened
for years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But whatever may have been the causes of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
policy, its effect was to intensify and spread the
spirit of self-reliance among the people of America.
A group of communities grew up along the western
shore of the Atlantic which formed the habit of
defending themselves, of developing their own resources,
of regulating their own affairs. It has
been well said that they were colonies only in the
Greek sense: communities which went forth from
the mother-country like children from a home, to
establish a self-sustaining and equal life. They
were not colonies in the Roman sense, suburbs of
the empire, garrisoned and ruled from the sole
centre of authority.</p>

<p>They felt, all of them, that they understood their
own needs, their own opportunities, their own
duties, their own dangers and hopes, better than
any one else could understand them. &ldquo;Those who
feel,&rdquo; said Franklin, when he appeared before the
committee of Parliament in London, &ldquo;can best
judge.&rdquo; They issued money, they made laws and
constitutions, they raised troops, they built roads,
they established schools and colleges, they levied
taxes, they developed commerce,&mdash;and this last
they did to a considerable extent in violation or
evasion of the English laws of navigation.</p>

<p>They acknowledged, indeed they fervently protested,
for a long time, their allegiance to Great
Britain and their loyalty to the crown; but they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
conceived their allegiance as one of equality, and
their loyalty as a voluntary sentiment largely influenced
by gratitude for the protection which the
king gave them in the rights of internal self-government.</p>

<p>This self-reliant spirit extended from the colonies
into the townships and counties of which they were
composed. Each little settlement, each flourishing
village and small city, had its own local interests,
and felt the wish and the ability to manage them.
And in these communities every man was apt to be
conscious of his own importance, his own value, his
own ability and right to contribute to the discussion
and settlement of local problems.</p>

<p>The conditions of life, also, had developed certain
qualities in the colonists which persisted and led to
a general temper of personal independence and self-confidence.
The men who had cleared the forests,
fought off the Indians, made homes in the wilderness,
were inclined to think themselves <i>capable de
tout</i>. They valued their freedom to prove this as
their most precious asset.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have some little property in America,&rdquo; said
Franklin. &ldquo;I will freely spend nineteen shillings
in the pound to defend the right of giving or refusing
the other shilling; and, after all, if I cannot
defend that right, I can retire cheerfully with my
little family into the boundless woods of America,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
which are sure to furnish freedom and subsistence
to any man who can bait a hook or pull a trigger.&rdquo;
It is rather startling to think of Franklin as gaining
his living as a hunter or a fisherman; but no doubt
he could have done it.</p>

<p>The wonderful prosperity and the amazing growth
of the colonies fostered this spirit of self-reliance.
Their wealth was increasing more rapidly, in proportion,
than the wealth of England. Their population
grew from an original stock of perhaps a
hundred thousand immigrants to two million in
1776, a twenty-fold advance; while in the same
period of time England had only grown from five
millions to eight millions, less than twofold.</p>

<p>The conflicts with the French power in Canada
also had a powerful influence in consolidating the
colonies and teaching them their strength. The
first Congress in which they were all invited to take
part was called in New York in 1690 to co&ouml;perate
in war measures against Canada. Three long,
costly, and bloody French-Indian wars, in which
the colonists felt they bore the brunt of the burden
and the fighting, drew them closer together, made
them conscious of their common interests and of
their resources.</p>

<p>But their victory in the last of these wars had
also another effect. It opened the way for a change
of policy on the part of Great Britain towards her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
American colonies,&mdash;a change which involved
their reorganization, their subordination to the authority
of the British Parliament, and the &ldquo;weaving&rdquo;
of them, as ex-Governor Pownall put it, into
&ldquo;a grand marine dominion consisting of our possessions
in the Atlantic and in America united into
one empire, into one centre where the seat of government
is.&rdquo; This was undoubtedly imperialism.
And it was because the Americans felt this that
the spirit of self-reliance rose against the new policy
and stubbornly resisted every step, even the smallest,
which seemed to them to lead in the direction
of subjugation and dependency.</p>

<p>Followed ten years of acrimonious and violent
controversy and eight years of war,&mdash;about what?
The Stamp Act? the Paint, Paper, and Glass Act?
the Tax on Tea? the Boston Port Bill?</p>

<p>No; but at bottom about the right and intention
of the colonies to continue to direct themselves.
You cannot possibly understand the American
Revolution unless you understand this. And without
an understanding of the causes and the nature
of the Revolution, you cannot comprehend the
United States of to-day.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the division of opinion among
the colonists themselves,&mdash;a division far more
serious and far more nearly equal in numbers than
is commonly supposed. It was not true, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
popular histories of the Revolution used to assume,
that all the brave, the wise, the virtuous, and the
honest were on one side, and all the cowardly, the
selfish, the base, and the insincere were on the other.
There was probably as much sincerity and virtue
among the loyalists as among the patriots. There
was certainly as much intelligence and education
among the patriots as among the loyalists. The
difference was this. The loyalists were, for the
most part, families and individuals who had been
connected, socially and industrially, with the royal
source of power and order, through the governors
and other officials who came from England or were
appointed there. Naturally they felt that the protection,
guidance, and support of England were indispensable
to the colonies. The patriots were, for
the most part, families and individuals whose intimate
relations had been with the colonial assemblies,
with the popular efforts for self-development
and self-rule, with the movements which tended to
strengthen their confidence in their own powers.
Naturally they felt that freedom of action, deliverance
from external control, and the fullest opportunity
of self-guidance were indispensable to the colonies.</p>

<p>The names chosen by the two parties&mdash;&ldquo;loyalist&rdquo;
and &ldquo;patriot&rdquo;&mdash;were both honourable, and
seem at first sight almost synonymous. But there is
a delicate shade of difference in their inward sig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>nificance.
The loyalist is one who sincerely owns
allegiance to a sovereign power, which <i>may</i> be
external to him, but to which he feels bound to be
loyal. The patriot is one who has found his own
country, <i>of which he is a part</i>, and for which he is
willing to live and die. It was because the patriotic
party appealed primarily to the spirit of self-reliance
that they carried the majority of the American
people with them, and won the victory, not only in
the internal conflict, but also in the war of independence.</p>

<p>I am not ignorant nor unmindful of the part
which European philosophers and political theorists
played in supplying the patriotic party in America
with logical arguments and philosophic reasons for
the practical course which they followed. The doctrines
of John Locke and Algernon Sidney were
congenial and sustaining to men who had already
resolved to govern themselves. From Holland aid
and comfort came in the works of Grotius. Italy
gave inspiration and support in the books of Beccaria
and Burlamaqui on the essential principles of
liberty. The French intellect, already preparing for
another revolution, did much to clarify and rationalize
American thought through the sober and
searching writings of Montesquieu, and perhaps
even more to supply it with enthusiastic eloquence
through the dithyrambic theories of Rousseau. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
doctrines of natural law, and the rights of man,
and the pursuit of happiness, were freely used by
the patriotic orators to enforce their appeals to the
people. It is impossible not to recognize the voice
of the famous Genevese in the words of Alexander
Hamilton: &ldquo;The sacred rights of men are not to
be rummaged for among old parchments or musty
records. They are written as with a sunbeam in the
whole volume of human nature by the hand of divinity
itself, and can never be erased by mortal power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it still remains true that the mainspring of
American independence is not to be found in any
philosophic system or in any political theory. It
was a vital impulse, a common sentiment in the
soul of a people conscious of the ability and the
determination to manage their own affairs. The
logic which they followed was the logic of events
and results. They were pragmatists. The spirit
of self-reliance led them on, reluctantly, inevitably,
step by step, through remonstrance, recalcitrance,
resistance, until they came to the republic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Permit us to be as free as yourselves,&rdquo; they said
to the people of Great Britain, &ldquo;and we shall ever
esteem a union with you to be our greatest glory
and our greatest happiness.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Parliament.
&ldquo;Protect us as a loving father,&rdquo; they said
to the king, &ldquo;and forbid a licentious ministry any
longer to riot in the ruins of mankind.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>&rdquo;
answered the king. &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said the
colonists, &ldquo;we are, and of right ought to be, free
and independent. We have governed ourselves.
We are able to govern ourselves. We shall continue
to govern ourselves, under such forms as we
already possess; and when these are not sufficient,
<i>we will make such forms as shall, in the opinion of
the representatives of the people, best conduce to the
happiness and safety of their constituents in particular
and of America in general</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This resolution of the Continental Congress, on
May 10, 1776, gives the key-note of all subsequent
American history. Republicanism was not adopted
because it was the only conceivable, or rational, or
legitimate, form of government. It was continued,
enlarged, organized, consolidated, because it was
the form in which the spirit of self-reliance in the
whole people found itself most at home, most happy
and secure.</p>

<p>The federal Union of the States was established,
after long and fierce argument, under the pressure
of necessity, because it was evidently the only way
to safeguard the permanence and freedom of those
States, as well as to &ldquo;establish justice, ensure domestic
tranquillity, provide for the common defence,
promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Amendments to the Constitution which were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
adopted in 1791 (and without the promise of which the
original document never would have been accepted)
were of the nature of a Bill of Rights, securing to
every citizen liberty of conscience and speech, protection
against arbitrary arrest, imprisonment, or
deprivation of property, and especially reserving to
the respective States or to the people all powers not
delegated to the United States.</p>

<p>The division of the general government into three
branches&mdash;legislative, executive, and judicial; the
strict delimitation of the powers committed to these
three branches; the careful provision of checks and
counterchecks intended to prevent the predominance
of any one branch over the others; all these are features
against which political theorists and philosophers
may bring, and have brought, strong arguments.
They hinder quick action; they open the way to
contests of authority; they are often a serious drawback
in international diplomacy. But they express
the purpose of a self-reliant people not to let the
ultimate power pass from their hands to any one of
the instruments which they have created. And for
this purpose they have worked well, and are still in
working order. For this reason the Americans are
proud of them to a degree which other nations
sometimes think unreasonable, and attached to
them with a devotion which other nations do not
always understand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Do not mistake me. In saying that American
republicanism is not the product of philosophical
argument, of abstract theory, of reasoned conviction,
I do not mean to say that Americans do not
believe in it. They do.</p>

<p>Now and then you will find one of them who says
that he would prefer a monarchy or an aristocracy.
But you may be sure that he is an eccentric, or a man
with a grievance against the custom-house, or a fond
person who feels confident of his own place in the royal
family or at least in the nobility. You may safely
leave him out in trying to understand the real Spirit
of America.</p>

<p>The people as a whole believe in the republic
very firmly, and at times very passionately. And
the vital reason for this belief is because it springs
out of life and is rooted in life. It comes from
that spirit of self-reliance which has been and is
still the strongest American characteristic, in the
individual, the community, and the nation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seems to me that we must apprehend this in
order to comprehend many things that are fundamental
in the life of America and the character of
her people. Let me speak of a few of these things,
and try to show how they have their roots in this
quality of self-reliance.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the singular political construc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>tion
of the nation,&mdash;a thing which Europeans find
it almost impossible to understand without a long
residence in America. It is a united country composed
of States which have a distinct individual life
and a carefully guarded sovereignty.</p>

<p>Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Illinois,
Texas, California, even the little States like Rhode
Island and Maryland, are political entities just as
real, just as conscious of their own being, as the United
States, of which each of them forms an integral part.
They have their own laws, their own courts, their
own systems of domestic taxation, their own flags,
their own militia, their own schools and universities.
&ldquo;The American citizen.&rdquo; Professor M&uuml;nsterberg
rightly says, &ldquo;in daily life is first of all a member
of his special State.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This distinction of local life is not to be traced to
an original allegiance to different owners or lords, a
duke of Savoy or Burgundy, a king of Prussia or
Saxony. It is quite unlike the difference among the
provinces of the French republic or the states of the
German Empire. It is primarily the result of a local
spirit of self-reliance, a habit of self-direction, in the
people who have worked together to build up these
States, to develop their resources, to give them shape
and substance. This is the true explanation of State
pride, and of the sense of an individual life in the
different commonwealths which compose the nation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>Every one knows that this feeling was so strong
immediately after the Revolution that it nearly
made the Union impossible. Every one knows
that this feeling was so strong in the middle of the
nineteenth century that it nearly destroyed the
Union. But every one does not know that this
feeling is still extant and active,&mdash;an essential and
potent factor in the political life of America.</p>

<p>The Civil War settled once for all the open and
long-disputed question of the nature of the tie which
binds the States together. The Union may be a
compact, but it is an indissoluble compact. The
United States is not a confederacy. It is a nation.
Yet the local sovereignty of the States which it embraces
has not been touched. The spirit of self-reliance
in each commonwealth guards its rights
jealously, and the law of the nation protects them.</p>

<p>It was but a little while ago that a proposal
was made in Congress to unite the territories of
Arizona and New Mexico and admit them to the
Union as one State. But the people of Arizona protested.
They did not wish to be mixed up with
people of New Mexico, for whom they professed
dislike and even contempt. They would rather
stay out than come in under such conditions. The
protest was sufficient to block the proposed action.</p>

<p>I have been reading lately a series of recent decisions
by the Supreme Court, touching on various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
questions, like the right of one State to make the
C.O.D. shipment of whiskey from another State a
penal offence, or the right of the United States to
interfere with the State of Colorado in the use of
the water of the Arkansas River for purposes of
irrigation. In all of these decisions, whether on
whiskey or on water, I find that the great principle
laid down by Chief Justice Marshall is clearly admitted
and sustained: &ldquo;The Government of the
United States is one of enumerated powers.&rdquo; Further
powers can be obtained only by a new grant from
the people. &ldquo;One cardinal rule,&rdquo; says Justice
Brewer, &ldquo;underlying all the relations of the States
to each other is that of equality of right. Each
State stands on the same level with all the rest. It
can impose its own legislation on none of the others,
and is bound to yield its own views to none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now it is evident that this peculiar structure of
the nation necessarily permits, perhaps implies, a
constant rivalry between two forms of the spirit of
self-reliance,&mdash;the local form and the general form.</p>

<p>Emphasize the one, and you have a body of
public opinion which moves in the direction of
strengthening, enhancing, perhaps enlarging, the
powers given to the central government. Emphasize
the other, and you have a body of public
opinion which opposes every encroachment upon
the powers reserved to the local governments, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
seeks to strengthen the whole by fortifying the parts
of which it is composed.</p>

<p>Here you have the two great political parties of
America. They are called to-day the Republican
and the Democratic. But the names mean nothing.
In fact, the party which now calls itself Democratic
bore the name of Republican down to 1832;
and those who were called successively Federalists
and Whigs did not finally take the name of Republicans
until 1860. In reality, political opinion, or
perhaps it would be more correct to say political
feeling, divides on this great question of the centralization
or the division of power. The controversy
lies between the two forms of the spirit of self-reliance;
that which is embodied in the consciousness
of the whole nation and that which is embodied
in the consciousness of each community. The
Democrats naturally speak for the latter; the Republicans
for the former.</p>

<p>Of course in our campaigns and elections the
main issue is often confused and beclouded. New
problems and disputes arise in which the bearing of
proposed measures is not clear. The parties have
come to be great physical organizations, with vested
interests to defend, with an outward life to perpetuate.
Like all human institutions, both of them
have the instinct of self-preservation. They both
try to follow the tide of popular sentiments. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
both insert planks in their platforms which seem
likely to win votes. Sometimes they both hit upon
the same planks, and it is very difficult to determine
the original ownership.</p>

<p>At present, for example, the great industrial and
commercial trusts and corporations are very unpopular.
The Democrats and the Republicans both
declare their intention to correct and restrain them.
Each party claims to be the original friend of the
people, the real St. George who will certainly slay
the Dragon of Trusts. Thus we have had the amusing
spectacle of Mr. Bryan commending and praising
Mr. Roosevelt for his conversion to truly Democratic
principles and policies, and adding that the
Democrats were the right men to carry them out,
while Mr. Taft insisted that the popular measures
were essentially Republican, and that his party was
the only one which could be trusted to execute them
wisely and safely.</p>

<p>But, in spite of these temporary bewilderments,
you will find, in the main, that the Republicans
have a tendency towards centralizing measures,
and therefore incline to favour national banks, a
protective tariff, enlargement of executive functions,
colonial expansion, a greater naval and military
establishment, and a consequent increase of national
expenditure; while the Democrats, as a rule, are on
the side of non-centralizing measures, and therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
inclined to favour a large and elastic currency, free
trade or tariff for revenue only, strict interpretation
of the Constitution, an army and navy sufficient for
police purposes, a progressive income tax, and a
general policy of national economy.</p>

<p>The important thing to remember is that these
two forms of the spirit of self-reliance, the general
and the local, still exist side by side in American
political life, and that it is probably a good thing to
have them represented in two great parties, in order
that a due balance may be kept between them.</p>

<p>The tendency to centralization has been in the
lead, undoubtedly, during the last forty years. It is
in accord with what is called the spirit of the age.
But the other tendency is still deep and strong in
America,&mdash;stronger I believe than anywhere else
in the world. The most valuable rights of the
citizen (except in territories and colonies), his personal
freedom, family relations, and property, are
still protected mainly by the State in which he lives
and of which he is a member,&mdash;a State which is
politically unknown to any foreign nation, and
which exists only for the other States which are
united with it!</p>

<p>A curious condition of affairs! Yet it is real. It
is historically accountable. It belongs to the Spirit
of America. For the people of that country think
with Tocqueville that &ldquo;Those who dread the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
license of the mob, and those who fear absolute
power, ought alike to desire the gradual development
of provincial liberties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the way in which America was made.
This is how Americans wish to keep it. An attempt
of either party in power to destroy the principle for
which the other stands would certainly fail. The
day when it seemed possible to dissolve the Union
is past. The day when the Union will absorb and
obliterate the States is not in sight.</p>

<p>But it is not only in this relation of the States
and the nation that you may see the workings of
the spirit of which I am speaking. Within each
State the spirit of self-reliance is developed and
cherished in city, county, and township. Public improvements,
roads and streets, police, education,&mdash;these
are the important things which, as a rule, the
State leaves to the local community. The city, the
county, the township, attend to them. They must
be paid for out of the local pocket. And the local
talent of the citizens feels able and entitled to regulate
them. Sometimes it is well done. Sometimes
it is very badly done. But the doing of it is a
privilege which a self-reliant people would be loath
to resign.</p>

<p>Each man wishes to have his share in the discussion.
The habit of argument is universal. The
confidence in the ultimate judgment of the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>munity
is general. The assurance of ability to lead
is frequent. And through the local office, the
small task, the way lies open to larger duties and
positions in the State and the nation.</p>

<p>It is not true that every native-born newsboy in
America thinks that he <i>can</i> become President. But
he knows that he <i>may</i> if he can; and perhaps it is
this knowledge, or perhaps it is something in his
blood, that often encourages him to try how far he
can go on the way. I suppose it is true that there
are more ambitious boys in America than in any
other country of the world.</p>

<p>At the same time this spirit of self-reliance works
in another and different direction. Within the
seemingly complicated politics of nation, State,
and town, each typical American is a person who
likes to take care of himself, to have his own way,
to manage his own affairs. He is not inclined to
rely upon the State for aid and comfort. He wants
not as much government as possible, but as little.
He dislikes interference. Sometimes he resents control.
He is an individual, a person, and he feels
very strongly that personal freedom is what he
most needs, and that he is able to make good use
of a large amount of it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now it is evident that such a spirit as this has its
weakness as well as its strength. It leads easily to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
overconfidence, to ignorant self-assurance, to rashness
in undertaking tasks, and to careless haste in
performing them.</p>

<p>It is good to be a person, but not good that
every person should think himself a personage. It
is good to be ready for any duty, but not good
to undertake any duty without making ready for it.</p>

<p>There are many Americans who have too little
respect for special training, and too much confidence
in their power to solve the problems of philosophy
and statesmanship extemporaneously.</p>

<p>No doubt there is a popular tendency to disregard
exceptional powers and attainments, and to
think that one man is as good as another. No
doubt you can find in America some cases of self-reliance
so hypertrophied that it amounts to impudence
towards the laws of the universe. This
is socially disagreeable, politically dangerous, and
morally regrettable.</p>

<p>Yet we must not forget the other side. The spirit
of self-reliance is not to be judged by its failures,
but by its successes.</p>

<p>It has enabled America to assert an independence
which the rest of the world, except France,
thought impossible; to frame a government which
the rest of the world, including France, thought impracticable;
and to survive civil storms and perils
which all the world thought fatal. It has animated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the American people with a large and cheerful
optimism which takes for granted that great things
are worth doing, and tries to do them. It has
made it easier to redeem a continent from the
ancient wilderness and to build on new ground a
civilized state sufficient to itself.</p>

<p>The spirit of self-reliance has fallen into mistakes,
but it has shunned delays, evasions, and
despairs. It has begotten explorers, pioneers, inventors.
It has trained masters of industry in the
school of action. It has saved the poor man from
the fetters of his poverty, and delivered the lowly
man from the prison of his obscurity.</p>

<p>Perhaps it has spoiled the worst material; but it
has made the most of the average material; and
it has bettered the best material. It has developed
in such leaders as Franklin, Washington, Jefferson,
Lincoln, Lee, Grant, and Cleveland a very noble
and excellent manhood, calm, steady, equal to all
emergencies.</p>

<p>Somehow it has brought out of the turmoil of
events and conflicts the soul of an adult people,
ready to trust itself and to advance into the new
day without misgiving.</p>

<h2>III<br />

FAIR PLAY AND DEMOCRACY</h2>


<p>It is no mistake to think of America as a democratic
country. But if you wish to understand the
nature and quality of the democracy which prevails
there,&mdash;its specific marks, its peculiarities,
and perhaps its inconsistencies,&mdash;you must trace
it to its source in <i>the spirit of fair play</i>. Therefore
it will be profitable to study this spirit a little more
carefully, to define it a little more clearly, and to
consider some illustrations of its working in American
institutions, society, and character.</p>

<p>The spirit of fair play, in its deepest origin, is a
kind of religion. It is true that religious organizations
have not always shown it so that it could be
identified by people outside. But this has been
the fault of the organizations. At bottom, fair play
is a man&rsquo;s recognition of the fact that he is not
alone in the universe, that the world was not made
for his private benefit, that the law of being is a
benevolent justice which must regard and rule him
as well as his fellow-men with sincere impartiality,
and that any human system or order which inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>feres
with this impartiality is contrary to the will of
the Supreme Wisdom and Love. Is not this a kind
of religion, and a very good kind? Do we not instinctively
recognize a Divine authority in its voice
when it says: &ldquo;Whatsoever ye would that men
should do unto you, do ye even so unto them&rdquo;?</p>

<p>But in its practical operation in everyday affairs
this spirit is not always conscious of its deep origin.
It is not usually expressed in terms of religion, any
more than an ordinary weighing-machine is inscribed
with the formula of gravitation. It appears
simply as the wish to conduct trade with just weights
and measures, to live in a State which affords equal
protection and opportunity to all its citizens, to play
a game in which the rules are the same for every
player, and a good stroke counts, no matter who
makes it.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon race has fallen into the habit
of claiming this spirit of fair play as its own peculiar
property. The claim does not illustrate the quality
which it asserts. Certainly no one can defend the
proposition that the growth of this spirit in America
was due exclusively, or even chiefly, to English influence.
It was in New England and in Virginia
that ecclesiastical intolerance and social exclusiveness
were most developed. In the middle colonies
like New York, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, where
the proportion of colonists from Holland, France,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and Germany was much larger, a more liberal and
tolerant spirit prevailed.</p>

<p>But, after all, it must be acknowledged that in
the beginning there was no part of America where
the spirit of self-reliance really carried with it that
necessary complement,&mdash;the spirit of fair play.
This was a thing of much slower growth. Indeed,
it was not until the American people, passionately
desiring self-rule, were brought into straits where
they needed the help of every man to fight for independence,
that they began to feel the right of
every man to share equally in the benefits and privileges
of that self-rule.</p>

<p>I pass by the discussion of the reasons why this
second trait in the soul of the people developed later
than the first. I pass by the tempting opportunity
to describe the absurd pretensions of colonial aristocracy.
I pass by the familiar theme of the inflexible
prejudices of Puritan theocracy, which led
men to interpret liberty of conscience as the right
to practise their own form of worship and to persecute
all others. I pass by the picturesque and neglected
spectacle of the violence of the mobs which
shouted for liberty&mdash;a violence which reminds one
of the saying of Rivarol that &ldquo;the crowd never believes
that it has liberty until it attacks the liberties
of others.&rdquo; All this I pass by for want of time,
and come at once to the classic utterance of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
spirit of fair play in America&mdash;I mean the Declaration
of Independence.</p>

<p>If I must apologize for discussing a document so
familiar, it is because familiarity, not being illuminated
by intelligence, has bred in these latter days
a certain kind of contempt. A false interpretation
has led the enthusiastic admirers of the Declaration
of Independence to complain that it has been
abandoned, and its scornful despisers to say that it
ought to be abandoned. The Declaration, in fact,
has been as variously and as absurdly explained as
the writings of St. Paul, of whom a French critic
said that &ldquo;the only man of the second century who
understood St. Paul was Marcion, and he <i>mis</i>understood
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Take the famous sentence from the beginning of
that document. &ldquo;We hold these truths to be self-evident;
that all men are created equal; that they
are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable
rights; that among these are life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men, deriving
their just powers from the consent of the governed;
that whenever any form of government becomes destructive
of these ends, it is the right of the people
to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new form
of government, laying its foundations on such principles
and organizing its power in such form as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and
happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now what have we here? A defence of revolution,
no doubt, but not a sweeping and unqualified
defence. It is carefully guarded and limited by the
condition that revolution is justified only when government
becomes destructive of its own ends,&mdash;the
security and the happiness of the people.</p>

<p>And what have we here in the way of political
doctrine? An assertion of the common rights of
man as derived from his Creator, no doubt, and an
implication that the specific prerogatives of rulers
are not of divine origin. But there is no denial that
the institution of government among men has a
divine sanction. On the contrary, such a sanction
is distinctly implied in the statement that government
is necessary for the security of rights divinely
given. There is no assertion of the divinity or even
the superiority of any particular form of government,
republican or democratic. On the contrary,
&ldquo;just powers&rdquo; are recognized as derivable from the
consent of the people. According to this view, a
happy and consenting people under George III or
Louis XVI would be as rightly and lawfully governed
as a happy people under a congress and a president.</p>

<p>And what have we here in the way of social
theory? An assertion of equality, no doubt, and
a very flat-footed and peremptory assertion. &ldquo;All<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
men are created equal.&rdquo; But equal in what? In
strength, in ability, in influence, in possessions. Not
a word of it. The assertion of such a thing in
an assembly which contained men as different as
George Washington, with his lofty stature and rich
estate, and Samuel Adams, for whose unimpressive
person his friends were sometimes obliged to supply
lodging and raiment, would have been a palpable
absurdity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; says Professor Wendell, &ldquo;the Declaration
only asserts that men are created equal, not that
they must remain so.&rdquo; Not at all. It implies
that what equality exists by creation ought to
remain by protection. It is, and ought to be,
inalienable.</p>

<p>But what is that equality? Not of person;
for that would be to say that all men are alike,
which is evidently false. Not of property; for
that would be to say that all men are on a level,
which never has been true, and, whether it is desirable
or not, probably never will be true. The
equality which is asserted among men refers simply
to the rights which are common to men: life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness. Here government
must make no distinctions, no exceptions. Here
the social order must impose no arbitrary and unequal
deprivations and barriers. The life of all is
equally sacred, the liberty of all must be equally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
secure, in order that the right of all to pursue happiness
may be equally open.</p>

<p><i>Equality of opportunity</i>: that is the proposition of
the Declaration of Independence. And when you
come to look at it closely, it does not seem at all
unreasonable. For it proposes no alteration in the
laws of the universe,&mdash;only a principle to be observed
in human legislation. It predicts no Utopia
of universal prosperity,&mdash;only a common adventure
of equal risks and hopes. It has not the accent
of that phrase, &ldquo;Liberty, equality, fraternity, or
death,&rdquo; which Chamfort translated so neatly, &ldquo;Be
my brother or I will kill you.&rdquo; It proceeds rather
upon the assumption that fraternity already exists.
It says, &ldquo;We are brothers; therefore let us deal
squarely with one another.&rdquo; It is, in fact, nothing
more and nothing less than the voice of the spirit
of fair play speaking gravely of the deepest interests
of man. Here, in this game of life, it says, as we
play it in America, the rules shall be the same for
all. The penalties shall be the same for all. The
prizes, so far as we can make it so, shall be open to
all. And let the best man win.</p>

<p>This, so far as I can see it, or feel it, or comprehend
it, is the sum total of democracy in America.</p>

<p>It is not an abstract theory of universal suffrage
and the infallibility of the majority. For, as a
matter of fact, universal suffrage never has existed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
in the United States and does not exist to-day.
Each State has the right to fix its own conditions of
suffrage. It may require a property qualification;
and in the past many States imposed this condition.
It may require an educational qualification; and
to-day some States are imposing this condition. It
may exclude the Chinese; and California, Oregon,
and Nevada make this exclusion. It may admit
only natives and foreigners who have been naturalized,
as the majority of the States do. It may
admit also foreigners who have merely declared
their intention of becoming naturalized, as eleven
of the States do. It may permit only men to vote,
or it may expressly grant the suffrage to every citizen,
male or female, as Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and
Utah do. The only thing that the law of the nation
says upon the subject is that when citizenship is
established, the right to vote shall not be denied or
abridged on account of race, colour, or previous
condition of servitude.</p>

<p>It is entirely possible, therefore, that within this
condition, suffrage should expand or contract in the
United States according to the will of the people.
Woman suffrage might come in next year without
the change of a word in the Constitution. All that
would be necessary would be a change in the mind
of the women, the majority of whom at present do
not want to vote, and would not do it if you paid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
them. On the other hand, educational and property
qualifications might be proposed which would reduce
the suffrage by a quarter or a third; but this,
again, is not likely to happen. The point is that
suffrage in America is not regarded as a universal
and inalienable human right, but as a political
privilege granted on the ground of fair play in order
to make the rights of the people more secure.</p>

<p>The undeniable tendency has been to widen the
suffrage; for Americans, as a rule, have a large confidence
in the reasonableness of human nature, and
believe that public opinion, properly and deliberately
ascertained, will prove to be a wise and safe
guide. But they recognize that a popular election
may not always represent public opinion, that a
people, like an individual, may and probably will
need time to arrive at the best thought, the wisest
counsel.</p>

<p>President Grover Cleveland, a confirmed and
inflexible Democrat, but not an obstreperous or
flamboyant one, often said to me, &ldquo;You can trust
the best judgment of the rank and file, but you
cannot always reach that best judgment in a hurry.&rdquo;
James Russell Lowell said pretty much the same
thing: &ldquo;An appeal to the reason of the people has
never been known to fail in the long run.&rdquo; <i>The
long run</i>,&mdash;that is the needful thing in the successful
working of popular suffrage. And that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Americans have tried to gain by the division and
distribution of powers, by the interposition of checks
and delays, by lodging extraordinary privileges of
veto in the hands of governors of States, and of the
President of the United States. In short, by making
swift action difficult and sudden action impossible,
they have sought to secure fair play, even from
the crowd, for every man and every interest.</p>

<p>There are some of us who think that this might
have been done more easily and more certainly if
the bounds of suffrage had not been made so wide.
We doubt, for example, whether a group of day-labourers
coming from Italy with their <i>padrone</i> are
really protected in their natural rights by having the
privilege of a vote before they can understand the
language of the land in which they cast it. So far
from being a protection, it seems to us like a danger.
It exposes them to the seductions of the demagogue
and to the control of the boss.</p>

<p>The suffrage of the ignorant is like a diamond
hung round the neck of a little child who is sent out
into the street: an invitation to robbers. It is like
a stick of dynamite in the hands of a foolish boy:
a prophecy of explosion.</p>

<p>There are some of us who think that &ldquo;coming
of age&rdquo; might be measured by intelligence as well
as by years; that it would be easier to get at the
mind of the people if the vote were cast by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
people who have minds; that a popular election
would come nearer to representing public opinion if
there were some way of sifting out at least a considerable
part of those electors who can neither read
nor write, nor understand the Constitution under
which they are voting.</p>

<p>But whatever may be the thoughts and wishes of
the more conservative Americans upon this subject,
two things are certain. One is that the privilege of
voting is a thing which is easy to give away and
very hard to take back. The other sure thing is
that the Spirit of America will never consent to any
restriction of the suffrage which rests upon artificial
distinctions, or seems to create ranks and orders
and estates within the body politic. If any conditions
are imposed, they must be the same for all.
If the privilege should be in any way narrowed, it
must still be open alike to all who will make the
necessary effort to attain it. This is fair play; and
this, so far as the suffrage and popular sovereignty
are concerned, is what American democracy means.
Not that every man shall count alike in the affairs
of state, but that every man shall have an equal
chance to make himself count for what he is worth.</p>

<p>Mark you, I do not say that this result has been
fully accomplished in the United States. The machinery
of parties interferes with it. The presentation
of men and of measures from a purely partisan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
point of view interferes with it. In any national
election it is reasonably sure that either the Republican
party or the Democratic party will win. The
policies and the candidates of both have been determined
in committee or caucus, by processes which
the ordinary citizen does not understand and cannot
touch. But what if he does not like the results
on either side? What if neither party seems to
him clear or consistent or satisfactory? Still he
must go with one or the other, or else be content
to assert his individuality and lose his electoral efficiency
by going in with one of the three or four
little parties which stand for moral protest, or intellectual
whim, or political vagary, without any possible
chance of carrying the election.</p>

<p>A thoughtful man sometimes feels as if he were
almost helpless amid the intricacies of the system by
which his opinion on national affairs is asked. He
sits with his vote in his hand as if it were some
strange and antiquated instrument, and says to
himself, &ldquo;Now what, in heaven&rsquo;s name, am I going
to do with this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the large cities, especially, this sense of impotence
is likely to trouble the intelligent and conscientious
American. For here a species of man
has developed called the <i>Boss</i>, who takes possession
of the political machinery and uses it for his own
purposes. He controls the party through a faction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and the faction through a gang, and the gang through
a ring, and the ring by his own will, which is usually
neither sweet nor savoury. He virtually owns the
public franchises, the public offices, the public payroll.
Like Rob Roy or Robin Hood, he takes
tribute from the rich and distributes it to the poor,&mdash;for
a consideration; namely, their personal loyalty
to him. He leads his followers to the polls as a
feudal chief led his retainers to battle. And the
men whom he has chosen, the policies which he
approves, are the ones that win.</p>

<p>What does this mean? The downfall of democracy?
No; only the human weakness of the system
in which democracy has sought to reach its ends;
only the failure in duty, in many cases, of the very
men who ought to have watched over the system in
order to prevent its corruption.</p>

<p>It is because good men in America too often neglect
politics that bad men sometimes control them. And,
after all, when the evil goes far enough, it secretes its
own remedy,&mdash;popular discontent, a reform movement,
a peaceful revolution. The way is open.
Speech is free. There is no need of pikes and
barricades and firebrands. There is a more powerful
weapon in every man&rsquo;s hand. Persuade him to
use it for his own good. Combine the forces of
intelligence and conscience, and the city which sees
its own interest will find out how to secure it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>But the trouble, with such a mass of voters, is
to produce this awakening, to secure this combination
of better forces. It is a trouble which Americans
often feel deeply, and of which they sometimes
complain bitterly. But after all, if you can
get down to the bottom of their minds, you will
find that they would rather take their trouble in
this form than in any other. They feel that there
is something wholesome and bracing in the idea
that people must want good government before they
can get it. And for the sake of this they are willing,
upon the whole, and except during intervals,
to give that eternal vigilance which is the price of
fair play.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not, however, of democracy as it has taken
shape in political forms that I would speak; but
rather of democracy as a spirit, a sentiment existing
in the soul of the American people. The root
of it is the feeling that the openings of life, so
far as they are under human control, ought to be
equal for all. The world may be like a house of
many stories, some higher, some lower. But there
shall be no locked doors between those stories.
Every stairway shall be unbarred. Every man shall
have his chance to rise. Every man shall be free
to pursue his happiness, and protected in the enjoyment
of his liberty, and secure in the possession of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
his life, so far as he does not interfere with others in
the same rights.</p>

<p>This does not mean that all shall be treated alike,
shall receive the same rewards. For, as Plato says,
&ldquo;The essence of equality lies in treating unequal
things unequally.&rdquo; But it means what the first
Napoleon called <i>la carri&egrave;re ouverte aux talents</i>.
Nay, it means a little more than that. For it goes
beyond the talents, to the mediocrities, to the inefficiencies,
and takes them into its just and humane
and unprejudiced account. It means what President
Roosevelt meant when he spoke of &ldquo;<i>the square
deal for everybody</i>.&rdquo; The soul of the American
people answered to his words because he had expressed
one of their dominant ideals.</p>

<p>You must not imagine that I propose to claim
that this ideal has been perfectly realized in America.
It is not true that every man gets justice there. It is
not true that none are oppressed or unfairly treated.
It is not true that every one finds the particular
stairway which he wishes to climb open and unencumbered.
But where is any ideal perfectly realized
except in heaven and in the writings of female novelists?
It is of the real desire and purpose, the good
intention, the aim and temper of the American people,
that I speak. And here I say, without doubt,
the spirit of fair play has been, and still is, one
of the creative and controlling factors of America.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>If you should ask me for the best evidence to
support this statement, I should at once name the
Constitution and the Supreme Court of the United
States. Here is an original institution, created and
established by the people at the very birth of the
nation, peculiar in its character and functions, I
believe, to America, and embodying in visible form
the spirit of fair play.</p>

<p>The laws under which a man must live in America
are of three kinds. There is first the common law,
which prevails in all the States except Louisiana,
which is still under the Napoleonic Code. The
common law, inherited from England, is contained
in the mass of decisions and precedents handed
down by the duly established courts from generation
to generation. It is supposed to cover the principles
which are likely to arise in almost all cases. But
when a new principle appears, the judge must decide
it according to his conscience and create the legal
right.</p>

<p>The second source of law is found in statutes
of the United States enacted by Congress, in the
constitutions of the different States, and in the
statutes enacted by the State legislatures. Here we
have definite rules and regulations, not arising out
of differences or disputes between individuals, but
framed on general principles, and intended to cover
all cases that may arise under them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>The third source of law is the Constitution of the
United States, which is supreme and sovereign over
all other laws. It is the enactment of the whole people.
Congress did not create it. It created Congress.
No legislation, whether of a State or of the nation,
can impair or contravene its authority. It can only
be changed by the same power which made it,&mdash;the
people of the United States, expressing their
will, first through a two-thirds majority of the national
House and Senate, and then directly through
the vote of three-fourths of the forty-six States.</p>

<p>Any statute which conflicts with the Constitution
is invalid. Any State constitution which fails to
conform to it is, in so far forth, non-existent. Any
judicial decision which contradicts it is of no binding
force. Over all the complexities of legislation and
the perplexities of politics in America stands this law
above the laws, this ultimate guarantee of fair play.</p>

<p>The thing to be noted in the Constitution is
this: brief as it is for the creative document of a
great nation, it contains an ample <i>Bill of Rights</i>,
protecting every man alike. The Constitution, as
originally framed in 1787, had omitted to do this
fully, though it prohibited the States from passing
any law to impair the validity of contracts, from
suspending the writ of habeas corpus in time of
peace, and from other things contrary to the spirit
of fair play. But it was evident at once that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Constitution would not be ratified by a sufficient
number of the States unless it went much farther.
Massachusetts voiced the Spirit of America in presenting
a series of amendments covering the ground
of equal dealing with all men in the matters most
essential to individual freedom and security. In
1790 these amendments, numbered from I to X,
were passed by Congress, and in 1791 they became
part of the Constitution.</p>

<p>What do they do? They guarantee religious
liberty, freedom of speech and of the press, and the
right of popular assembly and petition. They protect
every man, in time of peace, from criminal indictment
except by a grand jury, from secret trial,
from compulsion to testify against himself, from
being tried again for an offence of which he has
been once acquitted, and from the requisition of
excessive bail and the infliction of cruel or unusual
punishments. They guarantee to him the right to
be tried by an impartial jury of his peers and neighbours
in criminal cases and in all suits under common
law when the amount in controversy exceeds
twenty dollars in value. They protect his house
from search except under legal and specific warrant,
and his property from appropriation for public use
without just compensation. They assure him that
he shall not be deprived of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>The remarkable thing about these provisions for
fair play is not so much their nature as the place
where they are put. In England there is a Bill of
Rights, embodied in various enactments, which
covers pretty much the same ground. But these,
as Mr. James Bryce says, &ldquo;are merely ordinary
laws, which could be repealed by Parliament at any
moment in exactly the same way as it can repeal a
highway act or lower the duty on tobacco.&rdquo; But
in America they are placed upon a secure and lofty
foundation, they are lifted above the passing storms
of party politics. No State can touch them. No
act of Congress can touch them. They belong to
the law above laws.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. A supreme tribunal, co&ouml;rdinate
with the national executive and legislature, independent
and final in its action, is created by the
Constitution itself to interpret and apply this supreme
law. The nine judges who compose this
court are chosen from the highest ranks of the legal
profession, appointed by the President, and confirmed
by the Senate. They hold office for life.
Their court room is in the centre of the national
Capitol, between the wings appropriated to the
Senate and the House.</p>

<p>It is to that quiet chamber, so rich, so noble in
its dignity and simplicity, so free from pomp and
ostentation, so remote from turmoil and confusion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
so filled with the tranquil glory of intelligence and
conscience, so eloquent of confidence in the power
of justice to vindicate itself,&mdash;it is to that room
that I would take a foreigner who asked me why
I believe that democracy in America has the
promise of endurance. Those nine men, in their
black judicial robes (the only officials of the nation
who have from the beginning worn a uniform of
office), are the symbols of the American conscience
offering the ultimate guarantee of fair play. To
them every case in law and equity arising under
the Constitution, treaties and laws of the United
States, every case of admiralty and marine jurisdiction,
every case between citizens of different
States, or between two States, every case in which
the United States itself is a party, may be brought
for final decision. For more than a hundred years
this court has discharged its high functions without
a suspicion of corruption or a shadow of reproach.</p>

<p>Twenty-one times it has annulled the action of
Congress and declared it <i>ultra vires</i>. More than
two hundred times it has found that State statutes
were contrary to the Constitution and therefore
practically non-existent. And these decisions are
not made in the abstract, on theory, but in the concrete,
on actual cases when the principle of fair
play under the Constitution is at stake.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate this. In 1894 a law was passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
by Congress taxing all incomes over a certain sum
at certain rates. This was, in effect, not a tax based
proportionally upon population, but a special tax
upon a part of the population. It was also a direct
tax levied by the national legislature. There was
no necessity of discussing the abstract question of
the wisdom or righteousness of such taxation. The
only question was whether it was fair play under
the Constitution. A citizen of New York refused to
pay the tax; the case was brought to the Supreme
Court and argued by Mr. Choate, the late American
Ambassador to Great Britain. The court held
that Congress had no power to impose such a tax,
because the Constitution forbids that body to lay
any direct tax, &ldquo;unless in proportion to the census.&rdquo;
By this one decision the income-tax law became
null, as if it had never been.</p>

<p>Again, a certain citizen had obtained from the
State of Georgia a grant of land upon certain terms.
This grant was subsequently repealed by the State
by a general statute. A case arose out of the conveyance
of this land by a deed and covenant, and
was carried to the Supreme Court. The court held
that the statute of the State which took the citizen&rsquo;s
land away from him was null, because it &ldquo;impaired
the obligation of a contract,&rdquo; which the Constitution
expressly forbids.</p>

<p>Again, in 1890, Congress passed a measure com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>monly
called the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, declaring
&ldquo;every contract, combination in the form of
trusts or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of
trade or commerce among the several States&rdquo; to be
illegal. This was undoubtedly intended to prevent
the merger of railroads and manufacturing concerns
into gigantic trusts with monopolistic powers. The
American spirit has always understood liberty as
including the right of the citizen to be free in the
enjoyment of all his faculties, to live and work where
he will, and in so doing to move freely from State
to State. So far as the trusts were combinations in
restraint of this right, the statute properly declared
them illegal, and the Supreme Court so interpreted
and applied it. But it soon became evident that
combinations of labour might restrain trade just as
much as combinations of capital. A strike or a
boycott might paralyze an industry or stop a railroad.
The Supreme Court did not hesitate to
apply the same rule to the employees as to the employers.
It held that a combination whose professed
object is to arrest the operation of railroads
whose lines extend from a great city into adjoining
States until such roads accede to certain demands
made upon them, whether such demands are in
themselves reasonable or unreasonable, just or unjust,
is certainly an unlawful conspiracy in restraint
of commerce among the States.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Again and again the Supreme Court has interfered
to prevent citizens of all the States from being
deprived by the action of any State of those liberties
which belong to them in common. Again and
again its decisions have expressed and illustrated
the fundamental American conviction which is
summed up in the strong words of Justice Bradley:
&ldquo;The right to follow any of the common occupations
of life is an inalienable right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have not spoken of the other federal courts and
of the general machinery of justice in the United
States, because there is not time to do so. If it were
possible to characterize the general tendency in a
sentence, I would say that it lays the primary emphasis
on the protection of rights, and the secondary
emphasis on the punishment of offences. Looking
at the processes of justice from the outside, and
describing things by their appearance, one might
say that in many parts of the continent of Europe
an accused man looks guilty till he is proved innocent;
in America he looks innocent until his guilt is
established.</p>

<p>The American tendency has its serious drawbacks,&mdash;legal
delays, failures to convict, immunity
of criminals, and so on. These are unpleasant and
dangerous things. Yet, after all, when the thoughtful
American looks at his country quietly and
soberly he feels that a fundamental sense of justice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
prevails there not only in the courts but among the
people. The exceptions are glaring, but they are
still exceptions. And when he remembers the immense
and inevitable perils of a republic, he reassures
himself by considering the past history and
the present power of the Supreme Court, that
great bulwark against official encroachment, legislative
tyranny, and mobocracy,&mdash;that grave and
majestic symbol of the spirit of fair play. A republic
with such an institution at the centre of its
national conscience has at least one instrument of
protection against the dangers which lurk in the
periphery of its own passions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you should ask me for a second illustration of
the spirit of fair play in America, I should name
religious liberty and the peaceful independence of
the churches within the state. I do not call it the
&ldquo;Separation of Church and State,&rdquo; because I fear
that in France the phrase might carry a false meaning.
It might convey the impression of a forcible
rupture, or even a feeling of hostility, between the
government and the religious bodies. Nothing of
that kind exists in America. The state extends a
firm and friendly protection to the adherents of all
forms of religious belief or unbelief, defending all
alike in their persons, in the possession of their
property, and in their chosen method of pursuing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
happiness, whether in this world or in the next. It
requires only that they shall not practise as a part
of their cult anything contrary to public morality,
such as polygamy, or physical cruelty, or neglect
of children. Otherwise they are all free to follow
the dictates of conscience in worshipping or in not
worshipping, and in so doing they are under the
shield of government.</p>

<p>This is guaranteed not only by the Constitution
of the United States, but also by the separate State
constitutions, so far as I know, without exception.
Moreover, the general confidence and good-will of
the state towards the churches is shown in many
ways. Property used for religious purposes is exempted
from taxation,&mdash;doubtless on the ground
that these purposes are likely to promote good
citizenship and orderly living. Religious marriage
is recognized, but not required; and the act of a
minister of any creed is, in this particular, as valid
and binding as if he were a magistrate. But such
marriages must be witnessed and registered according
to law, and no church can annul them. It is
the common practice to open sessions of the legislature,
national and State, with an act of prayer; but
participation in this act is voluntary. The President,
according to ancient custom, appoints an
annual day of national thanksgiving in the month
of November, and his proclamation to this effect is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
repeated by the governors of the different States.
But here, again, it is a proclamation of liberty. The
people are simply recommended to assemble in their
various places of worship, and to give thanks according
to their conscience and faith.</p>

<p>The laws against blasphemy and against the disturbance
of public worship which exist in most of
the States offer an equal protection to a Jewish
synagogue, a Catholic cathedral, a Buddhist temple,
a Protestant church, and a Quaker meeting-house;
and no citizen is under any compulsion to enter any
one of these buildings, or to pay a penny of taxation
for their support. Each religious organization regulates
its own affairs and controls its own property.
In cases of dispute arising within a church the civil
law has decided, again and again, that the rule and
constitution of the church itself shall prevail.</p>

<p>But what of the religious bodies which exist under
this system? Do not imagine that they are small,
feeble, or insignificant; that they are content to be
merely tolerated; that they feel themselves in any
way impotent or slighted. They include the large
majority of the American people. Twelve millions
are adherents of the Catholic Church. The adherents
of the Protestant churches are estimated to
number between forty and fifty millions. But neither
as a whole, nor in any of their separate organizations,
do the religious people of America feel that they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
deprived of any real rights or robbed of any just
powers.</p>

<p>It is true that the different churches are sometimes
very jealous of one another. But bad as that
may be for them, from a political point of view it is
rather a safeguard.</p>

<p>It is true that ecclesiastics sometimes have
dreams, and perhaps schemes, which look towards
the obtaining of special privileges or powers for
their own organization. But that is because ecclesiastics
are human and fallible. In the main, you
may say with confidence that there is no party or
sect in America that has the slightest wish to see
church and state united, or even entangled. The
American people are content and happy that religion
should be free and independent. And this
contentment arises from three causes.</p>

<p>First, religious liberty has come naturally, peacefully,
in a moderate and friendly temper, with consideration
for the conscience and the rights of all,
and at the same time, if I mistake not, with a general
recognition that the essence of religion, personal
faith in a spiritual life and a Divine law, is a
purifying, strengthening, elevating factor in human
society.</p>

<p>Second, the churches have prospered in freedom;
they are well-to-do, they are active, they are able to
erect fine edifices, to support their clergy, to carry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
on benevolent and missionary enterprises on an immense
scale, costing many millions of dollars every
year. The voluntary system has its great disadvantages
and drawbacks,&mdash;its perils, even. But
upon the whole, religious people in America, Catholics,
Protestants, and Jews alike, feel that these are
more than counterbalanced by the devotion which
is begotten and nourished by the very act of making
gifts and sacrifices, and by the sober strength which
comes into a man&rsquo;s faith when he is called to support
it by his works.</p>

<p>Men value what they pay for. But this is true
only when they pay for what they really want.</p>

<p>Third, and chiefly, religious liberty commends
itself to the Americans because they feel that it is
the very highest kind of fair play. That a man
should have freedom in the affairs of his soul is
certainly most vital to his pursuit of happiness. The
noble example of tolerance which was set to the
American colonies by the Quakers of Pennsylvania,
the Baptists of Rhode Island, and the Catholics of
Maryland, prevailed slowly but surely over the
opposite example of the Puritans of Massachusetts
and the Anglicans of Virginia. The saying of
William of Orange, &ldquo;Conscience is God&rsquo;s province,&rdquo;
has become one of the watchwords of America.</p>

<p>In a country which, as a matter of fact, is predominantly
Christian and Protestant, there is neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
establishment nor proscription of any form of faith.
In the President&rsquo;s cabinet (1908) I personally know
a Jew, a Catholic, a Presbyterian, an Episcopalian,
and a Methodist. The President himself is a member
of one of the smallest denominations in the
country, the Dutch Reformed.</p>

<p>Nor is unfaith penalized or persecuted. A recent
writer on America has said that &ldquo;an avowed
atheist is not received in any social circles above
that of the ordinary saloon.&rdquo; Well, an atheist
avowed in definite and unmistakable terms, a man
who positively affirms that there is no God, is a very
difficult person to find in this world of mystery.
But a positivist, a free-thinker, a Voltairean, a sceptic,
an agnostic, an antisupernaturalist of any kind,
has the same rights and privileges as any other man.
In America, if his life is clean and his manners decent,
he goes everywhere. You may meet him in the best
clubs, and in social circles which are at the farthest
remove from the saloon. This is not because people
like his opinions, but because they feel he is entitled
to form them for himself. They take it for granted
that it is as impossible to correct unbelief by earthly
penalties as it is to deprive faith of its heavenly
rewards.</p>

<p>I do not say that this is the right attitude, the
only reasonable attitude. I do not wish to persuade
any one to adopt it. I say only that it is the char<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>acteristic
attitude of the Americans, and that sincerely
religious people hold it, in the Catholic Church
and in the Protestant Church. It may be that the
spirit of fair play has blinded them. It may be that
it has enlightened them. Be that as it may, they
have passed beyond the point of demanding freedom
of conscience for themselves to that of conceding
it to others. And in this they think that they
are acting in accordance with the Divine will and
example.</p>

<p>An anecdote will illustrate this attitude better
than many paragraphs of explanation. In the older
American colleges, which were independent of state
control, the original course of study was uniform
and prescribed, and chapel services were held which
the students were required to attend. Elective
studies came in. The oldest of the universities
made attendance at chapel voluntary. &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo;
said a critic to the president of the university,
&ldquo;that you have made God an elective in your
college.&rdquo; The President thought for a moment.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we understand that He has made
Himself elective everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are certain singular limitations in the
spirit of fair play in America of which I must say a
word in order to play fair. Chief among these is
the way in which the people of the colonies and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the United States dealt for many years with the
races which have not a white skin.</p>

<p>The American Indians, in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, undoubtedly sinned as much
as they were sinned against. They were treacherous,
implacable, unspeakably cruel, horribly bloodthirsty.
It is no wonder that the colonists regarded
them as devils. It is no wonder that the feeling of
mistrust and resentment persisted from one generation
to another. But the strange thing is that when
the Indians were subjugated and for the most part
pacified, America still treated them from a hostile
and alien point of view, denied them the rights of
citizenship, took their property from them, and
made it very difficult for them to pursue happiness
in any reasonable form. For many years this treatment
continued. It was so glaring that a book
was written which described the Indian policy of
the United States, not altogether unjustly, as <i>A
Century of Dishonor</i>. To-day all this is changed.
The scattered and diminished remnants of the red
men are admitted to citizenship if they wish it, and
protected in their rights, and private benevolence
vies with government in seeking to better their
condition.</p>

<p>The African race, introduced into America for
industrial reasons, multiplied more rapidly there
than in its native home, and soon became a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
factor in the population. But it was regarded and
treated from a point of view totally different from
that which controlled the treatment of the white
factors. It did not share in the rights enumerated
in the Declaration of Independence. It was an
object of commerce, a source of wealth, a necessity
of agriculture. The system of domestic slavery
held practically all of the negroes in bondage (in
spite of the fact that the Northern States abandoned
it, and many of the best men in the South disliked it
and protested against it) until the third quarter of
the nineteenth century. It was approved, or at
least tolerated, by the majority of the people until
the Civil War did away with it. It has left as a
legacy of retribution the most difficult and dangerous
problem of America,&mdash;perhaps the greatest and
most perplexing problem that any nation has ever
had to face.</p>

<p>Nine millions of negroes, largely ignorant and
naturally ill-fitted for self-government, are domiciled
in the midst of a white population which in some
sections of the South they outnumber. How to rule,
protect, and educate this body of coloured people;
how to secure them in their civil rights without admitting
them to a racial mixture&mdash;that is the
problem.</p>

<p>The Oriental races, recently coming to America
in increasing numbers, receive from the people a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
welcome which cannot be described as cordial.
The exclusion of the Chinese from citizenship, and
in some States from immigration, is but a small
symptom of the general situation. If any considerable
number of Burmese or East Indians or Japanese
should come, the situation would be the same, and
it would be intensified with the increase of the numbers.
They would not find the Americans inclined
to make an open career for the Oriental talents.</p>

<p>Understand, I am not now condemning this state
of affairs, nor am I defending it. That is not my
business. I am simply trying to describe it. How
is it to be reconciled with the spirit of fair play? I
do not know. Perhaps reconciliation is impossible.
But a partial understanding of the facts is possible,
if you take into account <i>the doctrine of inferior races</i>.</p>

<p>This doctrine is not held or defended by all Americans.
Some on religious grounds, some on philosophic
grounds, would deny it. But on the mass
of the people it has a firm, though in part an unrecognized,
hold. They believe&mdash;or perhaps feel
would be a better word&mdash;that the white race has
an innate superiority to the coloured races. From
this doctrine they have proceeded to draw conclusions,
and curiously enough they have put them in
the form of fair play. The Indians were not to be
admitted to citizenship because they were the wards
of the nation. The negroes were better off under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
slavery because they were like children, needing
control and protection. They must still be kept in
social dependence and tutelage because they will be
safer and happier so. The Orientals are not fit
for a share in American citizenship, and they shall
not be let in because they will simply give us another
inferior race to be taken care of.</p>

<p>I do not propose to discuss the philosophical
consistency of such arguments. It is difficult to
imagine what place Rousseau would have found for
them in his doctrine of the state of nature and the
rights of man.</p>

<p>The truth is that the Spirit of America has never
been profoundly impressed with the idea of philosophical
consistency. The Republic finds herself
face to face not with a theory but with a condition.
It is the immense mass of the African population
that creates the difficulty for America. She means
to give equal civil rights to her nine million negroes.
She does not mean to let the black blood mix with
the white. Whatever social division may be necessary
to prevent this immense and formidable adulteration
must be maintained intact.</p>

<p>Here, it seems to me, is the supreme test which
the Spirit of America has to meet. In a certain
sense the problem appears insoluble because it involves
an insoluble race. But precisely here, in the
necessity of keeping the negro race distinct, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the duty of giving it full opportunity for self-development,
fair play may find the occasion for a most
notable and noble triumph.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have left but a moment in which to speak of
the influence of the kind of democracy which exists
in America upon social conditions. In a word: it
has produced a society of natural divisions without
closed partitions, a temper of independence which
shows itself either as self-assertion or self-respect
according to the quality of the man, and an atmosphere
of large opportunity which promotes general
good humour.</p>

<p>In America, as elsewhere, people who have tastes
and capacities in common consort together. An
uneducated man will not find himself at ease in the
habitual society of learned men who talk principally
about books. A poor man will not feel comfortable
if he attempts to keep company with those whose
wealth has led them to immerse themselves in costly
amusements. This makes classes, if you like, ranks,
if you choose to call them so.</p>

<p>Moreover you will find that certain occupations
and achievements which men have generally regarded
with respect confer a kind of social distinction
in America. Men who have become eminent in the
learned professions, or in the army or navy, or in
the higher sort of politics; men who have won suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>cess
in literature or the other fine arts; men who
have done notable things of various kinds,&mdash;such
persons are likely to know each other better and to
be better known to the world than if they had done
nothing. Furthermore there are families in which
this kind of thing has gone on from generation to
generation; and others in which inherited wealth,
moderate or great, has opened the way to culture
and refinement; and others in which newly acquired
wealth has been used with generosity and dignity;
and others in which the mere mass of money has
created a noteworthy establishment. These various
people, divided among themselves by their tastes,
their opinions, and perhaps as much as anything
else by their favourite recreations, find their way
into the red book of <i>Who&rsquo;s Who</i>, into the blue book
of the Social Register. Here, if you have an imaginative
turn of mind, you may discover (and
denounce, or applaud, or ridicule) the beginnings
of an aristocracy.</p>

<p>But if you use that word, remember that it is an
aristocracy without legal privilege or prerogative,
without definite boundaries, and without any rule
of primogeniture. Therefore it seems to exist in the
midst of democracy without serious friction or hostility.
The typical American does not feel injured
by the fact that another man is richer, better known,
more influential than himself, unless he believes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
that the eminence has been unfairly reached. He
respects those who respect themselves and him. He
is ready to meet the men who are above him without
servility, and the men who are beneath him
without patronage.</p>

<p>True, he is sometimes a little hazy about the precise
definition of &ldquo;above&rdquo; and &ldquo;beneath.&rdquo; His
feeling that all the doors are open may lead him to
act as if he had already passed through a good
many of them. There is at times an &ldquo;I-could-if-I-would&rdquo;
air about him which is rather disconcerting.</p>

<p>There are great differences among Americans, of
course, in regard to manners, ranging all the way
from the most banal formality to the most exquisite
informality. But in general you may say that manners
are taken rather lightly, too lightly, perhaps,
because they are not regarded as very real things.
Their value as a means of discipline is often forgotten.
The average American will not blush very
deeply over a social blunder; he will laugh at it as
a mistake in a game. But to really hurt you, or to
lower his own independence, would make him feel
badly indeed.</p>

<p>The free-and-easy atmosphere of the streets, the
shops, the hotels, all public places, always strikes
the foreigner, and sometimes very uncomfortably.
The conductor on the railway car will not touch his
hat to you; but, on the other hand, he does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
expect a fee from you. The workman on the street
of whom you ask a question will answer you as an
equal, but he will tell you what you want to know.
In the country the tone of familiarity is even more
marked. If you board for the summer with a
Yankee farmer, you can see that he not only thinks
himself as good as you are, but that he cultivates a
slightly artificial pity for you as &ldquo;city folks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In American family life there is often an absence
of restraint and deference, in school and college life
a lack of discipline and subordination, which looks
ugly, and probably is rather unwholesome. One
sometimes regrets in America the want of those
tokens of respect which are the outward and visible
sign of an inward and spiritual grace.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, there is probably more
good feeling, friendliness, plain human kindness,
running around loose in America than anywhere
else in the world. The sense of the essential equality
of manhood takes away much of the sting of the
inequalities of fortune. The knowledge of the open
door reduces the offence of the stairway. It is
pleasant and wholesome to live with men who have
a feeling of the dignity and worth of their own
occupations.</p>

<p>Our letter-carrier at Princeton never made any
difference in his treatment of my neighbour President
Cleveland and myself. He was equally kind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
to both of us, and I may add equally cheerful in
rendering little friendly services outside of his strict
duty. My guides in the backwoods of Maine and
the Adirondacks regard me as a comrade who curiously
enough makes his living by writing books, but
who also shows that he knows the real value of life
by spending his vacation in the forest. As a matter
of fact, they think much more of their own skill
with the axe and paddle than of my supposed ability
with the pen. They have not a touch of subservience
in their manner or their talk. They do their
work willingly. They carry their packs, and chop
the wood, and spread the tents, and make the bed
of green boughs. And then, at night, around the
camp-fire, they smoke their pipes with me, and the
question is, Who can tell the best story?</p>

WILL-POWER, WORK, AND WEALTH</h2>


<p>The Spirit of America is best known in Europe by
one of its qualities,&mdash;<i>energy</i>. This is supposed to be
so vast, so abnormal, that it overwhelms and obliterates
all other qualities, and acts almost as a blind
force, driving the whole nation along the highroad
of unremitting toil for the development of physical
power and the accumulation of material wealth.</p>

<p><i>La vie intense</i>&mdash;which is the polite French
translation of &ldquo;the strenuous life&rdquo;&mdash;is regarded
as the unanimous choice of the Americans, who
are never happy unless they are doing something,
and never satisfied until they have made a great
deal of money. The current view in Europe
considers them as a well-meaning people enslaved
by their own restless activity, bound to the
service of gigantic industries, and captive to the
adoration of a golden idol. But curiously enough
they are often supposed to be unconscious both of
the slavery and of the idolatry; in weaving the
shackles of industrious materialism they imagine
themselves to be free and strong; in bowing down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
to the Almighty Dollar they ignorantly worship an
unknown god.</p>

<p>This European view of American energy, and its
inexplicable nature, and its terrible results, seems to
have something of the fairy tale about it. It is like
the story of a giant, dreadful, but not altogether
convincing. It lacks discrimination. In one point,
at least, it is palpably incorrect. And with that
point I propose to begin a more careful, and perhaps
a more sane, consideration of the whole subject.</p>

<p>It is evidently not true that America is ignorant
of the dangers that accompany her immense development
of energy and its application in such
large measure to material ends. Only the other
day I was reading a book by an American about
his country, which paints the picture in colours as
fierce and forms as flat as the most modern of
French decadent painters would use.</p>

<p>The author says: &ldquo;There stands America, engaged
in this superb struggle to dominate Nature
and put the elements into bondage to man. Involuntarily
all talents apply themselves to material
production. No wonder that men of science no
longer study Nature for Nature&rsquo;s sake; they must
perforce put her powers into harness; no wonder
that professors no longer teach knowledge for the
sake of knowledge; they must make their students
efficient factors in the industrial world; no wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
that clergymen no longer preach repentance for the
sake of the kingdom of heaven; they must turn
churches into prosperous corporations, multiplying
communicants and distributing Christmas presents
by the gross. Industrial civilization has decreed
that statesmanship shall consist of schemes to make
the nation richer, that presidents shall be elected
with a view to the stock-market, that literature
shall keep close to the life of the average man, and
that art shall become national by means of a protective
tariff....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The process of this civilization is simple: the
industrial habit of thought moulds the opinion of
the majority, which rolls along, abstract and impersonal,
gathering bulk till its giant figure is selected
as the national conscience. As in an ecclesiastical
state of society decrees of a council become articles
of private faith, and men die for homo&ouml;usion or election,
so in America the opinions of the majority,
once pronounced, become primary rules of conduct....
The central ethical doctrine of industrial
thought is that material production is the chief
duty of man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The author goes on to show that the acceptance
of this doctrine has produced in America &ldquo;<i>conventional
sentimentality</i>&rdquo; in the emotional life, &ldquo;<i>spiritual
feebleness</i>&rdquo; in the religious life, &ldquo;<i>formlessness</i>&rdquo; in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the social life, &ldquo;<i>self-deception</i>&rdquo; in the political life,
and a &ldquo;slovenly&rdquo; intelligence in all matters outside
of business. &ldquo;We accept sentimentality,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;because we do not stop to consider whether our
emotional life is worth an infusion of blood and
vigour, rather than because we have deliberately
decided that it is not. We neglect religion, because
we cannot spare time to think what religion means,
rather than because we judge it only worth a conventional
lip service. We think poetry effeminate,
because we do not read it, rather than because we
believe its effect injurious. We have been swept
off our feet by the brilliant success of our industrial
civilization; and, blinded by vanity, we enumerate
the list of our exports, we measure the swelling tide
of our national prosperity; but we do not stop even
to repeat to ourselves the names of other things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This rather sweeping indictment against a whole
civilization reminds me of the way in which one
of my students once defined rhetoric. &ldquo;Rhetoric,&rdquo;
said this candid youth, &ldquo;is the art of using words
so as to make statements which are not entirely correct
look like truths which nobody can deny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The description of America given by her sad
and angry friend resembles one of those relentless
portraits which are made by rustic photographers.
The unmitigated sunlight does its worst through an
unadjusted lens; and the result is a picture which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
is fearfully and wonderfully made. &ldquo;It looks like
her,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;it looks horribly like her. But
thank God I never saw her look just like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one can deny that the life of America has
developed more rapidly and more fully on the industrial
side than on any other. No one can deny
that the larger part, if not the better part, of her
energy and effort has gone into the physical conquest
of nature and the transformation of natural
resources into material wealth. No one can deny
that this undue absorption in one side of life has
resulted in a certain meagreness and thinness on
other sides. No one can deny that the immense
prosperity of America, and her extraordinary success
in agriculture, manufactures, commerce, and finance
have produced a swollen sense of importance, which
makes the country peddler feel as if he deserved
some credit for the $450,000,000 balance of foreign
trade in favour of the United States in 1907, and the
barber&rsquo;s apprentice congratulate himself that American
wealth is reckoned at $116,000,000,000, nearly
twice that of the next richest country in the world.
This feeling is one that has its roots in human
nature. The very cabin-boy on a monstrous ocean
steamship is proud of its tonnage and speed.</p>

<p>But that this spirit is not universal nor exclusive,
that there are some Americans who are not satisfied&mdash;who
are even rather bitterly dissatisfied&mdash;with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
$116,000,000,000 as a statement of national achievement,
the book from which I have quoted may be
taken as a proof. There are still better proofs to be
found, I think, in the earnestly warning voices which
come from press and pulpit against the dangers of
commercialism, and in the hundreds of thousands
of noble lives which are freely consecrated to ideals
in religion, in philanthropy, in the service of man&rsquo;s
intellectual and moral needs. These services are
ill-paid in America, as indeed they are everywhere,
but there is no lack of men and women who are
ready and glad to undertake them.</p>

<p>I was talking to a young man and woman the other
day, both thoroughbred Americans, who had resolved
to enter upon the adventure of matrimony together.
The question was whether he should accept an
opening in business with a fair outlook for making
a fortune, or take a position as teacher in a school
with a possible chance at best of earning a comfortable
living. They asked my advice. I put the
alternative as clearly as I could. On the one hand,
a lot of money for doing work that was perfectly
honest, but not at all congenial. On the other hand,
small pay in the beginning, and no chance of ever
receiving more than a modest competence for doing
work that was rather hard but entirely congenial.
They did not hesitate a moment. &ldquo;We shall get
more out of life,&rdquo; they said with one accord, &ldquo;if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
our work makes us happy, than if we get big pay
for doing what we do not love to do.&rdquo; They were
not exceptional. They were typical of the best
young Americans. The noteworthy thing is that
both of them took for granted the necessity of <i>doing
something</i> as long as they lived. The notion of a
state of idleness, either as a right or as a reward,
never entered their blessed young minds.</p>

<p>In later lectures I shall speak of some of the
larger evidences in education, in social effort, and in
literature, which encourage the hope that the emotional
life of America is not altogether a &ldquo;conventional
sentimentality,&rdquo; nor her spiritual life a complete
&ldquo;feebleness,&rdquo; nor her intelligence entirely
&ldquo;slovenly.&rdquo; But just now we have to consider the
real reason and significance of the greater strength,
the fuller development of the industrial life. Let
us try to look at it clearly and logically. My wish
is not to accuse, nor to defend, but first of all to
understand.</p>

<p>The astonishing industrial advance of the United
States, and the predominance of this motive in the
national life, come from the third element in the
spirit of America, <i>will-power</i>, that vital energy of
nature which makes an ideal of activity and efficiency.
&ldquo;The man who does things&rdquo; is the man
whom the average American admires.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>No doubt the original conditions of the nation&rsquo;s
birth and growth were potent in directing this
will-power, in transforming this energy into forces
of a practical and material kind. A new land
offered the opportunity, a wild land presented the
necessity, a rich land held out the reward, to men
who were eager to do something. But though the
outward circumstances may have moulded and
developed the energy, they did not create it.</p>

<p>Mexico and South America were new lands, wild
lands, rich lands. They are not far inferior, if at all,
to the United States in soil, climate, and natural resources.
They presented the same kind of opportunity,
necessity, and reward to their settlers and conquerors.
Yet they have seen nothing like the same
industrial advance. Why? There may be many
reasons. But I am sure that the most important
reasons lie in the soul of the people, and that one
of them is the lack, in the republics of the South,
of that strong and confident will-power which has
made the Americans a nation of hard and quick
workers.</p>

<p>This fondness for the active life, this impulse to
&ldquo;do things,&rdquo; this sense of value in the thing done,
does not seem to be an affair of recent growth in
America. It is an ancestral quality.</p>

<p>The men of the Revolution were almost all of them
busy and laborious persons, whether they were rich or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
poor. Read the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,
and you will find that he was as proud of the
fact that he was a good printer and that he invented
a new kind of stove as of anything else in his career.
One of his life mottoes under the head of industry is:
&ldquo;Lose no time; be always employed in something
useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.&rdquo; Washington,
retiring from his second term in the presidency,
did not seek a well-earned ease, but turned
at once to the active improvement of his estate.
He was not only the richest man, he was one of the
best practical farmers in America. His diary shows
how willingly and steadily he rode his daily rounds,
cultivated his crops, sought to improve the methods
of agriculture and the condition and efficiency of his
work-people. And this primarily not because he
wished to add to his wealth,&mdash;for he was a childless
man and a person of modest habits,&mdash;but because
he felt &ldquo;<i>il faut cultiver son jardin</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the nation had defended its independence
and consolidated its union, its first effort was to
develop and extend its territory. It was little more
than a string of widely separated settlements along
the Atlantic coast. Some one has called it a country
without an interior. The history of the pioneers
who pushed over the mountains of the Blue Ridge
and the Alleghanies, into the forests of Tennessee
and Kentucky, into the valleys of the Ohio and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Mississippi, and so on to the broad rolling prairies
of the West, is not without an interest to those who
feel the essential romance of the human will in a
world of intractable things. The transformation of
the Indian&rsquo;s hunting trail into the highroad, with
its train of creaking, white-topped wagons, and of
the highroad into the railway, with its incessant,
swift-rushing caravans of passengers and freight;
the growth of enormous cities like Chicago and St.
Louis in places that three generations ago were a
habitation for wild geese and foxes; the harnessing
of swift and mighty rivers to turn the wheels of
innumerable factories; the passing of the Great
American Desert, which once occupied the centre of
our map, into the pasture-ground of countless flocks
and herds, and the grain-field where the bread grows
for many nations,&mdash;all this, happening in a hundred
years, has an air of enchantment about it.
What wonder that the American people have been
fascinated, perhaps even a little intoxicated, by the
effect of their own will-power?</p>

<p>In 1850 they were comparatively a poor people,
with only $7,000,000,000 of national wealth, less
than $308 <i>per capita</i>. In 1906 they had become
a rich people, with $107,000,000,000 of national
wealth, more than $1300 <i>per capita</i>. In 1850 they
manufactured $1,000,000,000 worth of goods, in
1906 $14,000,000,000 worth. In 1850 they im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>ported
$173,000,000 worth of merchandise and exported
$144,000,000 worth. In 1906 the figures had
changed to $1,700,000,000 of merchandise exports
and $1,200,000,000 of imports. That is to say, in
one year America sold to other nations six dollars&rsquo;
worth <i>per capita</i> more than she needed to buy from
them.</p>

<p>I use these figures, not because I find them particularly
interesting or philosophically significant,
but because the mere size of them illustrates, and
perhaps explains, a point that is noteworthy in the
development of will-power in the American people:
and that is its characteristic spirit of <i>magnificence</i>.
I take this word for want of a better, and employ it,
according to its derivation, to signify the desire to
do things on a large scale. This is a spirit which is
growing everywhere in the modern civilized world.
Everywhere, if I mistake not, quantity is taking
precedence of quality in the popular thought.
Everywhere men are carried away by the attraction
of huge enterprises, immense combinations, enormous
results. One reason is that Nature herself
seems to have put a premium upon the mere mass
of things. In the industrial world it appears as if
Napoleon were right in his observation that &ldquo;God
is on the side of the big battalions.&rdquo; Another reason
is the strange, almost hypnotic, effect that number
has upon the human mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>But while the spirit of &ldquo;the large scale&rdquo; is gaining
all over the world, among the Americans it
seems to be innate and most characteristic. Perhaps
the very size of their country may have had
something to do with this. The habit of dealing
with land in terms of the square mile and the quarter-section,
instead of in the terms of the <i>are</i> and the
<i>hectare</i>; the subconscious effect of owning the longest
river and the largest lakes in the world may have
developed a half-humorous, half-serious sense of
necessity for doing things magnificently in order
to keep in proportion with the natural surroundings.
A well-known American wit, who had a slight
impediment in his speech, moved his residence
from Baltimore to New York. &ldquo;Do you make as
many jokes here,&rdquo; asked a friend, &ldquo;as you used to
make in Baltimore?&rdquo; &ldquo;M-m-more!&rdquo; he answered;
&ldquo;b-b-bigger town!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To produce more corn and cotton than all the
rest of the world together, to have a wheat crop
which is more than double that of any other country;
to mine a million tons of coal a year in excess of
any rival; to double Germany&rsquo;s output of steel and
iron and to treble Great Britain&rsquo;s output,&mdash;these
are things which give the American spirit the sense
of living up to its opportunities.</p>

<p>It likes to have the tallest buildings in the world.
New York alone contains more than twenty-five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
architectural eruptions of more than twenty stories
each. There is an edifice now completed which is
909 feet in height. One is planned which will be
1000 feet tall, 16 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower.
This new building will not be merely to gratify (or
to shock) the eye like the Parisian monument of
magnificence in architecture. &ldquo;The Eiffel Tower,&rdquo;
says the American, &ldquo;is not a real sky-scraper,
<i>gratte-ciel</i>; it is only a sky-tickler, <i>chatouille-ciel</i>;
nothing more than a <i>jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i> which man has
played with the law of gravitation. But our American
tall building will be strictly for business, a
serious affair, the office of a great life-insurance
company.&rdquo; There is a single American factory
which makes 1500 railway locomotives every year.
There is a company for the manufacture of harvesting-machines
in Chicago whose plant covers 140
acres, whose employees number 24,000, and whose
products go all over the world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was the desire to promote industrial
development that led to the adoption of the
protective tariff as an American policy. The people
wanted to do things, to do all sorts of things, and to
do them on a large scale. They were not satisfied
to be merely farmers, or miners, or fishermen, or
sailors, or lumbermen. They wished to exercise
their energy in all possible ways, and to secure their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
prosperity by learning how to do everything necessary
for themselves. They began to lay duties
upon goods manufactured in Europe in order to
make a better market at home for goods manufactured
in America. &ldquo;Protection of infant industries&rdquo;
was the idea that guided them. There have been
occasional intervals when the other idea, that of
liberty for needy consumers to buy in the cheapest
market, has prevailed, and tariffs have been reduced.
But in general the effort has been not only to raise
a large part of the national income by duties on
imports, but also to enhance the profits of native
industries by putting a handicap on foreign competition.</p>

<p>There can be no question that the result has been
to foster the weaker industries and make them
strong, and actually to create some new fields for
American energy to work in. For example, in 1891
there was not a pound of tin-plate made in the
United States, and 1,000,000,000 pounds a year were
imported. The McKinley tariff put on an import
duty of 70 per cent. In 1901 only a little over
100,000,000 pounds of tin-plate were imported, and
nearly 900,000,000 pounds were made in America.
The same thing happened in the manufacture of
watches. A duty of 25 per cent on the foreign
article gave the native manufacturer a profit, encouraged
the development of better machinery, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
made the American watch tick busily around the
world. Now (1908) the duty is 40 per cent <i>ad
valorem</i>.</p>

<p>No one in the United States would deny these
facts. No one, outside of academic circles, would
call himself an absolute, unmitigated, and immediate
free-trader. But a great many people, probably
the majority of the Democratic party, and a
considerable number in the Republican party, say
to-day that many of the protective features of the
tariff have largely accomplished their purpose and
gone beyond it; that they have not only nourished
weak industries, but have also overstimulated strong
ones; that their continuance creates special privileges
in the commercial world, raises the cost of the
necessities of life to the poor man, tends to the promotion
of gigantic trusts and monopolies, and encourages
overproduction, with all its attendant evils
enhanced by an artificially sustained market.</p>

<p>They ask why a ton of American steel rail should
cost twenty-six or twenty-seven dollars in the country
where it is made, and only twenty dollars in Europe.
They inquire why a citizen of Chicago or St. Louis
has to pay more for an American sewing-machine
or clock than a citizen of Stockholm or Copenhagen
pays for the same article. They say that a heavy
burden has been laid upon the common people by a
system of indirect taxation, adopted for a special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
purpose, and maintained long after that purpose
has been fulfilled. They claim that for every dollar
which this system yields to the national revenue it
adds four or five dollars to the profits of the trusts
and corporations. If they are cautious by temperament,
they say that they are in favour of moderate
tariff revision. If they are bold, they announce their
adherence to the doctrine of &ldquo;tariff for revenue
only.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The extent to which these views have gained
ground among the American people may be seen in
the platforms of both political parties in the presidential
contest of 1908. Both declare in favour of a
reduction in the tariff. The Republicans are for
continued protective duties, with revision of the
schedules and the adoption of maximum and minimum
rates, to be used in obtaining advantages from
other nations. The Democrats are for placing products
which are controlled by trusts on the free list;
for lowering the duty upon all the necessaries of
life at once; and for a gradual reduction of the
schedules to a revenue basis. The Democrats are
a shade more radical than the Republicans. But
both sides are a little reserved, a little afraid to
declare themselves frankly and unequivocally, a
good deal inclined to make their first appeal to the
American passion for industrial activity and prosperity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Personally I should like to see this reserve vanish.
I should like to see an out-and-out campaign on the
protection which our industries need compared with
that which they want and get. It would clear the
air. It would be a campaign of education. I
remember what the greatest iron-master of America&mdash;Mr.
Andrew Carnegie&mdash;said to me in 1893
when I was travelling with him in Egypt. It was
in the second term of Cleveland&rsquo;s administration,
when the prospect of tariff reduction was imminent.
I asked him if he was not afraid that the duty on
steel would be reduced to a point that would ruin
his business. &ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and I
have told the President so. The tariff was made
for the protection of infant industries. But the steel
business of America is not an infant. It is a giant.
It can take care of itself.&rdquo; Since that time the
United States Steel Corporation has been formed,
with a capitalization of about fifteen hundred million
dollars of bonds and stock, and the import duty on
manufactured iron and steel is 45 per cent <i>ad valorem</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another effect of the direction of American
energy to industrial affairs has been important not
only to the United States but to all the nations of
the world. I mean the powerful stimulus which it
has given to invention. People with restless minds
and a strong turn for business are always on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
lookout for new things to do and new ways of
doing them. The natural world seems to them like
a treasure-house with locked doors which it is their
duty and privilege to unlock. No sooner is a new
force discovered than they want to slip a collar
over it and put it to work. No sooner is a new
machine made than they are anxious to improve it.</p>

<p>The same propensity makes a public ready to try
new devices, and to adopt them promptly as soon
as they prove useful. &ldquo;Yankee notions&rdquo; is a slang
name that was once applied to all sorts of curious
and novel trifles in a peddler&rsquo;s stock. But to-day
there are a hundred Yankee notions without the
use of which the world&rsquo;s work would go on much
more slowly. The cotton-gin takes the seeds from
seven thousand pounds of cotton in just the same
time that a hand picker formerly needed to clean a
pound and a half. An American harvesting-machine
rolls through a wheat-field, mowing, threshing, and
winnowing the wheat, and packing it in bags, faster
than a score of hands could do the work. The
steamboat, the sewing-machine, the electric telegraph,
the type-writer, the telephone, the incandescent
light,&mdash;these are some of the things with
which American ingenuity and energy have been
busy for the increase of man&rsquo;s efficiency and power
in the world of matter. The mysterious force or
fluid which Franklin first drew quietly to the earth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
with his little kite and his silken cord has been put
to a score of tasks which Franklin never dreamed of.
And in the problem of aerial navigation, which is
now so much in the air everywhere, it looks as if
American inventors might be the first to reach a
practical solution.</p>

<p>I do not say that this indicates greatness. I say
only that it shows the presence in the Spirit of
America of a highly developed will-power, strong,
active, restless, directed with intensity to practical
affairs. The American inventor is not necessarily,
nor primarily, a man who is out after money. He
is hunting a different kind of game, and one which
interests him far more deeply: a triumph over nature,
a conquest of time or space, the training of
a wild force, or the discovery of a new one. He
likes money, of course. Most men do. But the
thing that he most loves is to take a trick in man&rsquo;s
long game with the obstinacy of matter.</p>

<p>Edison is a typical American in this. He has
made money, to be sure; but very little in comparison
with what other men have made out of his
inventions. And what he gains by one experiment
he is always ready to spend on another, to risk in a
new adventure. His real reward lies in the sense of
winning a little victory over this secretive world, of
taking another step in the subjugation of things to
the will of man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>There is probably no country where new inventions,
labour-saving devices, improved machinery,
are as readily welcomed and as quickly taken up as
in America. The farmer wants the newest plough,
the best reaper and mower. His wife must have a
sewing-machine of the latest model; his daughter a
pianola; his son an electric runabout or a motor-cycle.
The factories are always throwing out old
machinery and putting in new. The junk-heap is
enormous. The waste looks frightful; and so it
would be, if it were not directed to a purpose which
in the end makes it a saving.</p>

<p>American cities are always in a state of transition.
Good buildings are pulled down to make room for
better ones. My wife says that &ldquo;New York will be
a delightful place to live in when it is finished.&rdquo;
But it will never be finished. It is like Tennyson&rsquo;s
description of the mystical city of Camelot:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">&ldquo;always building,</span><br />
Therefore never to be built at all.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">But unlike Camelot, it is not built to music,&mdash;rather
to an accompaniment of various and dreadful
noise.</p>

<p>Even natural catastrophes which fall upon cities
in America seem to be almost welcomed as an invitation
to improve them. A fire laid the business
portion of Baltimore in ashes a few years ago. Be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>fore
the smoke had dispersed, the Baltimoreans were
saying, &ldquo;Now we can have wider streets and larger
stores.&rdquo; An earthquake shook San Francisco to
pieces. The people were stunned for a little while.
Then they rubbed the dust out of their eyes, and
said, &ldquo;This time we shall know how to build better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The high stimulation of will-power in America
has had the effect of quickening the general pace
of life to a rate that always astonishes and sometimes
annoys the European visitor. The movement
of things and people is rapid, incessant, bewildering.
There is a rushing tide of life in the streets, a nervous
tension in the air. Business is transacted with
swift despatch and close attention. The preliminary
compliments and courtesies are eliminated. Whether
you want to buy a paper of pins, or a thousand shares
of stock, it is done quickly. I remember that I
once had to wait an hour in the Ottoman Bank at
Damascus to get a thousand francs on my letter of
credit. The courteous director gave me coffee and
delightful talk. In New York the transaction would
not have taken five minutes,&mdash;but there would
have been no coffee nor conversation.</p>

<p>Of course the rate of speed varies considerably in
different parts of the country. In the South it is
much slower than in the North and the West. In
the rural districts you will often find the old-fashioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
virtues of delay and deliberation carried to an exasperating
point of perfection. Even among the
American cities there is a difference in the rapidity
of the pulse of life. New York and Chicago have
the name of the swiftest towns. Philadelphia has
a traditional reputation for a calm that borders on
somnolence. &ldquo;How many children have you?&rdquo;
some one asked a Chicagoan. &ldquo;Four,&rdquo; was his
answer; &ldquo;three living, and one in Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was reading only a few day ago an amusing
description of the impression which the American
<i>pas-redoubl&eacute;</i> of existence made upon an amiable
French observer, M. Hugues Le Roux, one of the
lecturers who came to the United States on the
Hyde foundation. He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Everywhere you see the signs of shopkeepers who promise
to do a lot of things for you &lsquo;<i>while you wait</i>.&rsquo; The tailor
will press your coat, the hatter will block your hat, the shoemaker
will mend your shoe,&mdash;<i>while you wait</i>. At the barber
shops the spectacle becomes irresistibly comic. The
American throws himself back in an arm-chair to be shaved,
while another artist cuts his hair; at the same time his two
feet are stretched out to a bootblack, and his two hands are
given up to a manicure....</p>

<p>&ldquo;If &lsquo;Step lively&rsquo; is the first exclamation that a foreigner
hears on leaving the steamship, &lsquo;Quick&rsquo; is the second. Everything
here is quick. In the business quarter you read in
the windows of the restaurants, as their only guarantee of
culinary excellence, this alluring promise: &lsquo;Quick lunch!&rsquo;...</p>

<p>&ldquo;The American is born &lsquo;quick&rsquo;; works &lsquo;quick&rsquo;; eats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
&lsquo;quick&rsquo;; decides &lsquo;quick&rsquo;; gets rich &lsquo;quick&rsquo;; and dies &lsquo;quick.&rsquo;
I will add that he is buried &lsquo;quick.&rsquo; Funerals cross the city
<i>au triple galop</i>.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>So far as it relates to the appearance of things,
what the philosopher would call the phenomenal
world, this is a good, though slightly exaggerated,
description. I have never been so fortunate as to
see a man getting a &ldquo;shave&rdquo; and a &ldquo;hair-cut&rdquo; at
the same moment; and it seems a little difficult
to understand precisely how these two operations
could be performed simultaneously, unless the man
wore a wig. But if it can be done, no doubt the
Americans will learn to have it done that way. As
for the hair-cutter, the manicure, and the bootblack,
the combination of their services is already
an accomplished fact, made possible by the kindness
of nature in placing the head, the hands, and
the feet at a convenient distance from one another.
Even the Parisian barbers have taken advantage of
this fact. They sell you a bottle of hair tonic at the
same time.</p>

<p>It is true that the American moves rapidly. But
if you should infer from these surface indications that
he is always in a hurry, you would make a mistake.
His fundamental philosophy is that you must be
quick sometimes if you do not wish to be hurried
always. You must condense, you must eliminate,
you must save time on the little things in order that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
you may have more time for the larger things. He
systematizes his correspondence, the labour of his
office, all the details of his business, not for the
sake of system, but for the sake of getting through
with his work.</p>

<p>Over his desk hangs a printed motto: &ldquo;This
is my busy day.&rdquo; He does not like to arrive at
the railway station fifteen minutes before the departure
of his train, because he has something
else that he would rather do with those fifteen
minutes. He does not like to spend an hour in the
barber-shop, because he wishes to get out to his
country club in good time for a game of golf and
a shower-bath afterward. He likes to have a full
life, in which one thing connects with another
promptly and neatly, without unnecessary intervals.
His characteristic attitude is not that of a man in a
hurry, but that of a man concentrated on the thing
in hand in order to save time.</p>

<p>President Roosevelt has described this American
trait in his familiar phrase, &ldquo;the strenuous life.&rdquo; In
a man of ardent and impetuous temperament it
may seem at times to have an accent of overstrain.
Yet this is doubtless more in appearance than in
reality. There is probably no man in the world
who has comfortably gotten through with more
work and enjoyed more play than he has.</p>

<p>But evidently this American type of life has its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
great drawbacks and disadvantages. In eliminating
the intervals it is likely to lose some of the
music of existence. In laying such a heavy stress
upon the value of action it is likely to overlook the
part played by reflection, by meditation, by tranquil
consideration in a sane and well-rounded
character.</p>

<p>The critical faculty is not that in which Americans
excel. By this I do not mean to say that they
do not find fault. They do, and often with vigour
and acerbity. But fault-finding is not criticism in
the true sense of the word. Criticism is a disinterested
effort to see things as they really are, to
understand their causes, their relations, their effects.
In this effort the French intelligence seems more at
home, more penetrating, better balanced than the
American.</p>

<p>Minds of the type of Sainte Beuve or Bruneti&egrave;re
are not common, I suppose, even in France. But
in America they are still more rare. Clear, intelligent,
thoroughgoing, well-balanced critics are not
much in evidence in the United States; first, because
the genius of the country does not tend to
produce them; and second, because the taste of the
people does not incline to listen to them.</p>

<p>There is a spirit in the air which constantly cries,
&ldquo;Act, act!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Let us still be up and doing.&rdquo;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p class="noidt">The gentle voice of that other spirit which whispers,
&ldquo;Consider, that thou mayest be wise,&rdquo; is often unheard
or unheeded.</p>

<p>It is plain that the restless impulse to the active
life, coming from the inward fountain of will-power,
must make heavy drafts upon its source, and put a
severe strain upon the channels by which it is conveyed.
The nerves are worn and frayed by constant
pressure. America is the country of young
men, but many of them look old before their time.
Nervous exhaustion is common. Neurasthenia, I
believe, is called &ldquo;the American disease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, curiously enough, it was in France that the
best treatment of this disease was developed, and
one of the most famous practitioners, Dr. Charcot,
died, if I mistake not, of the complaint to the cure
of which he had given his life. In spite of the fact
that nervous disorders are common among Americans,
they do not seem to lead to an unusual number
of cases of mental wreck. I have been looking
into the statistics of insanity. The latest figures
that I have been able to find are as follows: In
1900 the United States had 106,500 insane persons
in a population of 76,000,000. In 1896 Great
Britain and Ireland had 128,800 in a population of
37,000,000. In 1884 France had 93,900 in a population
of 40,000,000. That would make about 328
insane persons in 100,000 for Great Britain, 235 in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
every 100,000 for France, 143 in every 100,000 for
America.</p>

<p>Nor does the wear and tear of American life,
great as it may be, seem to kill people with extraordinary
rapidity. As a matter of fact, M. Le Roux
was led away by the allurements of his own style
when he wrote that the American &ldquo;dies quick.&rdquo; In
1900 the annual death-rate per 1000 in Austria was
25, in Italy 23, in Germany 22, in France 21, in
Belgium 19, in Great Britain 18, and in the United
States 17. In America the average age at death in
1890 was 31 years; in 1900 it was 35 years. Other
things, such as climate, sanitation, hygiene, have to
be taken into account in reading these figures. But
after making all allowance for these things, the
example of America does not indicate that an active,
busy, quick-moving life is necessarily a short one.
On the contrary, hard work seems to be wholesome.
Employed energy favours longevity.</p>

<p>But what about the amount of pleasure, of real
joy, of inward satisfaction that a man gets out of
life? Who can make a general estimate in a matter
which depends so much upon individual temperament?
Certainly there are some deep and quiet
springs of happiness which look as if they were in
danger of being choked and lost, or at least which
do not flow as fully and freely as one could wish, in
America.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>The tranquil pleasure of the household where
parents and children meet in intimate, well-ordered,
affectionate and graceful fellowship&mdash;the <i>foyer</i>, as
the best French people understand and cherish it&mdash;is
not as frequent in America as it might be, nor
as it used to be. There are still many sweet and
refreshing homes, to be sure. But &ldquo;the home&rdquo; as a
national institution, the centre and the source of
life, is being crowded out a little. Children as well
as parents grow too busy for it.</p>

<p>Human intercourse, also, suffers from the lack
of leisure, and detachment, and delight in the interchange
of ideas. The average American is not
silent. He talks freely and sometimes well, but he
usually does it with a practical purpose. Political
debate and business discussion are much more in
his line than general conversation. Thus he too
often misses what Montaigne and Samuel Johnson
both called one of the chief joys of life,&mdash;&ldquo;a good
talk.&rdquo; I remember one morning, after a certain
dinner in New York, an acquaintance who was one
of the company met me, and said, &ldquo;Do you know
that we dined last night with thirty millions of
dollars?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and we had conversation
to the amount of about thirty cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Popular recreations and amusements, pleasures
of the simpler kind such as are shared by masses
of people on public holidays, do not seem to afford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
as much relaxation and refreshment in America as
they do in Germany or France. Children do not
take as much part in them. There is an air of
effort about them, as if the minds of the people
were not quite free from care. The Englishman is
said to take his pleasure sadly. The American is
apt to take his strenuously.</p>

<p>Understand, in all this I am speaking in the most
general way, and of impressions which can hardly
be defined, and which certainly cannot be mathematically
verified. I know very well that there
are many exceptions to what I have been saying.
There are plenty of quiet rooms in America, club-rooms,
college-rooms, book-rooms, parlours, where
you will find the best kind of talk. There are
houses full of children who are both well-bred and
happy. There are people who know how to play,
with a free heart, not for the sake of winning, but
for the pleasure of the game.</p>

<p>Yet I think it true that a strong will-power directed
chiefly to industrial success has had a hardening
effect upon the general tone of life. Unless you
really love work for its own sake, you will not be
very happy in America. The idea of a leisure class
is not fully acclimatized there. Men take it for
granted that there must be something useful for
them to do in the world, even though they may not
have to earn a living.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>This brings me to the last point of which I wish
to speak: the result of will-power and work in the
production of wealth, and the real status of the
Almighty Dollar in the United States.</p>

<p>The enormous increase of wealth has been accompanied
by an extraordinary concentration of it
in forms which make it more powerful and impressive.
Moody&rsquo;s <i>Manual of Corporation Statistics</i>
says that there are four hundred and forty large
industrial, franchise, and transportation trusts, of
an important and active character, with a floating
capital of over twenty billion dollars. When we
remember that each of these corporations is in the
eye of the law a person, and is able to act as a person
in financial, industrial, and political affairs, we begin
to see the tremendous significance of the figures.</p>

<p>But we must remember also that the growth of
individual fortunes and of family estates has been
equally extraordinary. Millionnaires are no longer
counted. It is the multi-millionnaires who hold the
centre of the stage. The <i>New York World Almanac</i>
gives a list of sixteen of these families of vast wealth,
tracing the descent of their children and grandchildren
with scrupulous care, as if for an <i>Almanach
de Gotha</i>. I suppose that another list might be
made twice as large,&mdash;three or four times as large,&mdash;who
knows how large,&mdash;of people whose fortune
runs up into the tens of millions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>These men have a vast power in American finance
and industry, not only by the personal possession of
money, but also through the control of the great
trusts, railroads, banks, in which they have invested
it. The names of many of them are familiar throughout
the country. Their comings and goings, their
doings, opinions, and tastes are set forth in the
newspapers. Their houses, their establishments, in
some cases are palatial; in other cases they are
astonishingly plain and modest. But however that
may be, the men themselves, as a class, are prominent,
they are talked about, they hold the public
attention.</p>

<p>What is the nature of this attention? Is it the
culminating rite in the worship of the Almighty
Dollar? No; it is an attention of curiosity, of
natural interest, of critical consideration.</p>

<p>The dollar <i>per se</i> is no more almighty in America
than it is anywhere else. It has just the same kind
of power that the franc has in France, that the
pound has in England: the power to buy the things
that can be bought. There are foolish people in
every country who worship money for its own sake.
There are ambitious people in every country who
worship money because they have an exaggerated
idea of what it can buy. But the characteristic
thing in the attitude of the Americans toward money
is this: not that they adore the dollar, but that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
they admire the energy, the will-power, by which
the dollar has been won.</p>

<p>They consider the multi-millionnaire much less as
the possessor of an enormous fortune than as the
successful leader of great enterprises in the world
of affairs, a master of the steel industry, the head
of a great railway system, the developer of the production
of mineral oil, the organizer of large concerns
which promote general prosperity. He represents
to them achievement, force, courage, tireless
will-power.</p>

<p>A man who is very rich merely by inheritance,
who has no manifest share in the activities of the
country, has quite a different place in their attention.
They are entertained, or perhaps shocked,
by his expenditures, but they regard him lightly.</p>

<p>It is the man who does things, and does them
largely, in whom they take a serious interest. They
are inclined, perhaps, to pardon him for things that
ought not to be pardoned, because they feel so
strongly the fascination of his potent will, his practical
efficiency.</p>

<p>It is not the might of the dollar that impresses
them, it is the might of the man who wins the dollar
magnificently by the development of American
industry.</p>

<p>This, I assure you, is the characteristic attitude of
the typical American toward wealth. It does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
confer a social status by itself in the United States
any more than it does in England or in France.
But it commands public attention by its relation to
national will-power.</p>

<p>Of late there has come into this attention a new
note of more searching inquiry, of sharper criticism,
in regard to the use of great wealth.</p>

<p>Is it employed for generous and noble ends, for
the building and endowment of hospitals, of public
museums, libraries, and art galleries, for the support
of schools and universities, for the education of the
negro? Then the distributer is honoured.</p>

<p>Is it devoted even to some less popular purpose,
like Egyptian excavations, or polar expeditions, or
the endowment of some favourite study,&mdash;some
object which the mass of the people do not quite
understand, but which they vaguely recognize as
having an ideal air? Then the donor is respected
even by the people who wonder why he does that
particular thing.</p>

<p>Is it merely hoarded, or used for selfish and extravagant
luxury? Then the possessor is regarded
with suspicion, with hostility, or with half-humorous
contempt.</p>

<p>There is, in fact, as much difference in the comparative
standing of multi-millionnaires in America
as there is in the comparative standing of lawyers
or politicians. Even in the same family, when a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
great fortune is divided, the heir who makes a good
and fine use of the inheritance receives the tribute
of affection and praise, while the heir who hoards
it, or squanders it ignobly, receives only the tribute
of notoriety,&mdash;which is quite a different thing.
The power of discrimination has not been altogether
blinded by the glitter of gold. The soul of the
people in America accepts the law of the moral
dividend which says <i>Richesse oblige</i>.</p>

<p>Here I might stop, were it not for the fact that still
another factor is coming into the attitude of the
American people toward great wealth, concentrated
wealth. There is a growing apprehension that the
will-power of one man may be so magnified and
extended by the enormous accumulation of the
results of his energy and skill as to interfere with
the free exercise of the will-power of other men.
There is a feeling that great trusts carry within
themselves the temptation to industrial oppression,
that the liberty of individual initiative may be
threatened, that the private man may find himself
in a kind of bondage to these immense and potent
artificial personalities created by the law.</p>

<p>Beyond a doubt this feeling is spreading. Beyond
a doubt it will lead to some peaceful effort to regulate
and control the great corporations in their
methods. And if that fails, what then? Probably
an effort to make the concentration of large wealth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
in a few hands more difficult if not impossible.
And if that fails, what then? Who knows? But I
think it is not likely to be anything of the nature of
communism.</p>

<p>The ruling passion of America is not equality,
but personal freedom for every man to exercise
his will-power under a system of self-reliance and
fair play.</p>

<h2>V<br />

COMMON ORDER AND SOCIAL CO&Ouml;PERATION</h2>


<p>It is a little strange, and yet it seems to be true,
that for a long time America was better understood
by the French than by the English. This may be
partly due to the fact that the French are more idealistic
and more excitable than the English; in both of
which qualities the Americans resemble them. It
may also be due in part to the fact that the American
Revolution was in a certain sense a family quarrel.
A prolonged conflict of wills between the older
and the younger members of the same household
develops prejudices which do not easily subside.
The very closeness of the family relation intensifies
the misunderstanding. The seniors find it extremely
difficult to comprehend the motives of the juniors, or
to believe that they are really grown up. They
seem like naughty and self-confident children. A
person outside of the family is much more likely to
see matters in their true light.</p>

<p>At all events, in the latter part of the eighteenth
century, when Dr. Samuel Johnson was calling the
Americans &ldquo;a race of convicts, who ought to be
thankful for anything we allow them short of hang<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>ing,&rdquo;
and declaring that he was willing to love all
mankind <i>except the Americans</i>, whom he described
as &ldquo;Rascals&mdash;Robbers&mdash;Pirates,&rdquo; a Frenchman,
named Cr&egrave;vec&#339;ur, who had lived some twenty years
in New York, gave a different portrait of the same
subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then is the American,&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;this new
man? He is either a European or the descendant
of a European, hence that strange mixture of
blood which you will find in no other country.
I could point out to you a family whose grandfather
was an Englishman, whose wife was Dutch, whose
son married a Frenchwoman, and whose present four
sons have now wives of four different nations....
Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new
race of men whose labours and posterity will one day
cause great changes in the world. Americans are the
western pilgrims, who are carrying along with them
that great mass of arts, sciences, vigour, and industry
which began long since in the East. They will
finish the great circle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the language of compliment, of course. It
is the saying of a very polite prophet; and even in
prophecy one is inclined to like pleasant manners.
Yet that is not the reason why it seems to Americans
to come much nearer to the truth than Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s
remarks, or Charles Dickens&rsquo;s <i>American Notes</i>,
or Mrs. Trollope&rsquo;s <i>Domestic Manners of the Ameri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>cans</i>.
It is because the Frenchman has been clear-sighted
enough to recognize that the Americans
started out in life with an inheritance of civilized
ideals, manners, aptitudes, and powers, and that
these did not all come from one stock, but were
assembled from several storehouses. This fact, as
I have said before, is fundamental to a right understanding
of American character and history. But it
is particularly important to the subject of this
lecture: <i>the sentiment of common order</i>, and the
building-up of a settled, decent, sane life in the
community.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that a family of barbarians,
either from some native impulse, or under the influence
of foreign visitors, should begin to civilize
themselves. Their course would be slow, irregular,
and often eccentric. It would alternate between
servile imitation and wild originality. Sometimes
it would resemble the costume of that Australian
chief who arrayed himself in a stove-pipe hat and
polished boots and was quite unconscious of the need
of the intermediate garments.</p>

<p>But suppose we take an example of another kind,&mdash;let
us say such a family as that which was
made famous fifty years ago by a well-known work
of juvenile fiction, <i>The Swiss Family Robinson</i>.
They are shipwrecked on a desert island. They
carry ashore with them their tastes, their habits,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
their ideas of what is desirable and right and fitting
for decent people in the common life. It is because
their souls are not naked that they do not wish their
bodies to become so. It is because there is already
a certain order and proportion in their minds that
they organize their tasks and their time. The
problem before them is not to think out a civilized
existence, but to realize one which already exists
within them, and to do this with the materials which
they find on their island, and with the tools and implements
which they save from their wrecked ship.</p>

<p>Here you have precisely the problem which confronted
the Americans. They began housekeeping
in a wild land, but not as wild people. An English
lady once asked Eugene Field of Chicago whether
he knew anything about his ancestors. &ldquo;Not much,
madam,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but I believe that mine lived
in trees when they were first caught.&rdquo; This was an
illustration of conveying truth by its opposite.</p>

<p>The English Pilgrims who came from Norwich
and Plymouth, the Hollanders who came from Amsterdam
and Rotterdam, the Huguenots who came
from La Rochelle and Rouen were distinctly not tree-dwellers
nor troglodytes. They were people who
had the habits and preferences of a well-ordered
life in cities of habitation, where the current of existence
was tranquil and regular except when disturbed
by the storms of war or religious persecution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
And those who came from the country districts,
from the little villages of Normandy and Poitou and
Languedoc, of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire and
Cornwall, of Friesland and Utrecht, of the Rhenish
Palatinate, and of the north of Ireland, were not
soldiers of fortune and adventurers. They were for
the most part peaceable farmers, whose ideal of
earthly felicity was the well-filled barn and the comfortable
fireside.</p>

<p>There were people of a different sort, of course,
among the settlers of America. England sent a good
many of her bankrupts, incurable idlers, masterless
men, sons of Belial, across the ocean in the early days.
Some writers say that she sent as many as 50,000 of
them. Among the immigrants of other nations
there were doubtless many &ldquo;who left their country
for their country&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; It is silly to indulge in
illusions in regard to the angelic purity and unmixed
virtue of the original American stock.</p>

<p>But the elements of turbulence and disorder were
always, and are still, in the minority. Whatever
interruption they caused in the development of a
civilized and decent life was local and transient.
The steady sentiment of the people who were in
control was in favour of common order and social
co&ouml;peration.</p>

<p>There is a significant passage in the diary of John
Adams, written just after the outbreak of mob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
violence against the loyalists in 1775. A man had
stopped him, as he was riding along the highway, to
congratulate him on the fury which the patriots and
their congress had stirred up, and the general dissolution
of the bonds of order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Adams, what great things have you and
your colleagues done for us. We can never be
grateful enough to you. There are no courts of
justice now in this province, and I hope there will
never be another.&rdquo; Upon which the indignant
Adams comments: &ldquo;Is this the object for which I
have been contending, said I to myself, for I rode
along without any answer to this wretch; are these
the sentiments of such people, and how many of them
are there in this country? Half the nation for what
I know: for half the nation are debtors, if not more;
and these have been in all countries the sentiments of
debtors. If the power of the country should get into
such hands, and there is great danger that it will, to
what purpose have we sacrificed our time, our health,
and everything else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the fears of the sturdy old Puritan and patriot
were not realized. It was not into the hands of such
men as he despised and dreaded, nor even into the
hands of such men as Mr. Rudyard Kipling&rsquo;s imaginary
American,</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Enslaved, illogical, elate ...<br />
Unkempt, disreputable, vast,&rdquo;<br />
</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p class="noidt">that the power of the country fell. It was into the
hands of men of a very different type, intelligent as
well as independent, sober as well as self-reliant,
inheritors of principles well-matured and defined,
friends of liberty in all their policies, but at the bottom
of their hearts lovers and seekers of tranquil order.</p>

<p>I hear the spirit of these men speaking in the
words of him who was the chosen leader of the people
in peace and in war. Washington retired from his
unequalled public service with the sincere declaration
that he wished for nothing better than to partake,
&ldquo;in the midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence
of good laws under a free government, the
ever favourite object of my heart, and the happy reward,
as I trust, of our mutual cares, labours, and
dangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In these nobly simple and eloquent words, the
great American expresses clearly the fourth factor in
the making of his country,&mdash;<i>the love of common
order</i>. Here we see, in the mild light of unconscious
self-revealment, one of the chief ends which the Spirit
of America desires and seeks. Not merely a self-reliant
life, not merely a life of equal opportunity
for all, not merely an active, energetic life in which
the free-will of the individual has full play, but also
a life shared with one&rsquo;s fellow-citizens under the
benign influence of good laws, a life which is controlled
by principles of harmony and fruitful in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
efforts co&ouml;perant to a common end, a life <i>rang&eacute;e,
ordonn&eacute;e, et solidaire</i>,&mdash;this is the American ideal.</p>

<p>With what difficulty men worked out this ideal
in outward things in the early days we can hardly
imagine. Those little communities, scattered along
the edge of the wilderness, had no easy task to
establish and maintain physical orderliness. Nature
has her own order, no doubt, but her ways are
different from man&rsquo;s ways; she is reluctant to submit
to his control; she does not like to have her hair
trimmed and her garments confined; she even communicates
to man, in his first struggles with her, a
little of her own carelessness, her own apparently reckless
and wasteful way of doing things. &ldquo;Rough and
ready&rdquo; is a necessary maxim of the frontier. It is
hard to make a new country or a log cabin look neat.</p>

<p>To this day in America, even in the regions which
have been long settled, one finds nothing like the excellent
trimness, the precise and methodical arrangement,
of the little farmsteads of the Savoy among
which these lectures were written. My memory often
went back, last summer, from those tiny unfenced
crops laid out like the squares of a chess-board in the
valleys, from those rich pastures hanging like green
velvet on the steep hillsides, from those carefully
tended forests of black firs, from those granges with
the little sticks of wood so neatly piled along their
sides under the shelter of the overhanging eaves, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the straggling fences, the fallow fields, the unkempt
meadows, the denuded slopes, the shaggy underbrush,
the tumbled woodpiles, and the general signs
of waste and disorder which may be seen in so many
farming districts of the United States. I asked
myself how I could venture to assure a French
audience, in spite of such apparent evidences to the
contrary, that the love of order was a strong factor
in the American spirit.</p>

<p>But then I began to remember that those farms
of New England and New York and New Jersey were
won only a few generations ago from a trackless and
savage wilderness; that the breadth of their acres
had naturally tempted the farmer to neglect the less
fruitful for the more productive; that Nature herself
had put a larger premium upon energy than upon
parsimony in these first efforts to utilize her resources;
and that, after all, what I wished to describe
and prove was not an outward triumph of universal
orderliness in material things, but an inward desire
of order, the wish to have a common life well
arranged and regulated, tranquil and steady.</p>

<p>Here I began to see my way more clear. Those
farms of eastern America, which would look to a foreigner
so rude and ill-kept, have nourished a race of
men and women in whom regularity and moral
steadiness and consideration of the common welfare
have been characteristic traits. Their villages and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
towns, with few exceptions, are well cared for physically;
and socially, to use a phrase which I heard
from one of my guides in Maine, they are &ldquo;as calm
as a clock.&rdquo; They have their Village Improvement
Societies, their Lyceum Lecture Courses, their
Public Libraries, their churches (often more than
they need), and their schoolhouses, usually the
finest of all their buildings. They have poured into
the great cities, year after year, an infusion of strong
and pure American blood which has been of the
highest value, not only in filling the arteries of
industry and trade and the professions with a fresh
current of vigorous life, but also in promoting the
rapid assimilation of the mass of foreign immigrants.
They have sent out a steady flood of westward-moving
population which has carried with it the ideals and
institutions, the customs and the habits, of common
order and social co&ouml;peration.</p>

<p>On the crest of the advancing wave, to be sure, there
is a picturesque touch of foam and fury. The first
comers, the prospectors, miners, ranchers, land-grabbers,
lumbermen, adventurers, are often rough and
turbulent, careless of the amenities, and much given
to the profanities. But they are the men who
break the way and open the path. Behind them
come the settlers bringing the steady life.</p>

<p>I could wish the intelligent foreigner to see the
immense corn-fields of Indiana, Illinois, and Kansas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the vast wheat-fields of the Northwest, miles and miles
of green and golden harvest, cultivated, reaped, and
garnered with a skill and accuracy which resembles
the movements of a mighty army. I could wish him
to see the gardens and orchards of the Pacific slope,
miles and miles of opulent bloom and fruitage,
watered by a million streams, more fertile than the
paradise of Damascus. I could wish him to see the
towns and little cities which have grown up as if by
magic everywhere, each one developing an industry,
a social life, a civic consciousness of its own, in forms
which, though often bare and simple, are almost
always regular and respectable even to the point of
monotony. Then perhaps he would believe that the
race which has done these things in a hundred years
has a real and deep instinct of common order.</p>

<p>But the peculiarly American quality in this instinct
is its individualism. It does not wish to be
organized. It wishes to organize itself. It craves
form, but it dislikes formality. It prizes and
cherishes the sense of voluntary effort more than the
sense of obedience. It has its eye fixed on the end
which it desires, a peaceable and steady life, a tranquil
and prosperous community. It sometimes overlooks
the means which are indirectly and obscurely
serviceable to that end. It is inclined to be suspicious
of any routine or convention whose direct practical
benefit is not self-evident. It has a slight contempt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
for etiquette and manners as superficial things. Its
ideal is not elegance, but utility; not a dress-parade,
but a march in comradeship toward a common goal.
It is reluctant to admit the value of the parade even
as a discipline and preparation for the march. Often
it demands so much liberty for the individual that the
smooth interaction of the different parts of the community
is disturbed or broken.</p>

<p>The fabric of common order in America is sound
and strong at the centre. The pattern is well-marked,
and the threads are firmly woven. But the edges are
ragged and unfinished. Many of our best cities have
a fringe of ugliness and filth around them which is
like a torn and bedraggled petticoat on a woman
otherwise well dressed.</p>

<p>Approaching New York, or Cincinnati, or Pittsburg,
or Chicago, you pass first through a delightful region,
where the homes of the prosperous are spread upon
the hills, reminding you of a circle of Paradise; and
then through a region of hideous disorder and new
ruins, which has the aspect of a circle of Purgatory,
and makes you doubt whether it is safe to go any
farther for fear you may come to a worse place.
This neglected belt of hideous suburbs around some
of the richest cities in the world is typical and
symbolical. It speaks of the haste with which
things have been done; of the tendency to overlook
detail, provided the main purpose is accomplished;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of the lack of thoroughness, and the indifference
to appearance, which are common American faults.
It suggests, also, the resistance which a strong
spirit of individualism offers to civic supervision and
control; the tenacity with which men cling to their
supposed right to keep their houses in dirt and disorder;
the difficulty of making them comply with
general laws of sanitation and public improvement;
and the selfishness with which land-owners will leave
their neglected property to disfigure the city from
whose growth they expect in ten or twenty years to
reap a large profit.</p>

<p>Yet, as a matter of fact, this very typical mark of an
imperfect sense of the value of physical neatness and
orderliness in American life is not growing, but diminishing.
The fringes of the cities are not nearly as bad
as they were thirty or forty years ago. In many of
them,&mdash;notably in Philadelphia and Boston and
some of the western cities,&mdash;beauty has taken the
place of ugliness. Parks and playgrounds have been
created where formerly there were only waste places
filled with rubbish. Tumble-down shanties give
way to long rows of trim little houses. Even the
factories cease to look like dingy prisons and put on
an air of self-respect. Nuisances are abolished.
The country can draw near to the city without
holding its nose.</p>

<p>This gradual improvement, also, is symbolical.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
It speaks of individualism becoming conscious of its
own defects and dangers. It speaks of an effort on
the part of the more intelligent and public-spirited
citizens to better the conditions of life for all. It
speaks of a deep instinct in the people which responds
to these efforts and supports them with the necessary
laws and enactments. It speaks most of all, I hope,
of that underlying sense of common order which is
one of the qualities of the Spirit of America.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate this, first, by some observations on
the average American crowd.</p>

<p>The obvious thing about it which the foreigner is
likely to notice is its good humour. It is largely
made up of native optimists, who think the world is
not a bad place to live in, and who have a cheerful
expectation that they are going to get along in it.
Although it is composed of rather excitable individuals,
as a mass it is not easily thrown into passion
or confusion. The emotion to which it responds
most quickly is neither anger nor fear, but laughter.</p>

<p>But it has another trait still more striking, and that
is its capacity for self-organization. Watch it in
front of a ticket-office, and see how quickly and instinctively
it forms &ldquo;the line.&rdquo; No police are needed.
The crowd takes care of itself. Every man finds
his place, and the order once established is strictly
maintained by the whole crowd. The man who tries
to break it is laughed at and hustled out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>When an accident happens in the street, the throng
gathers in a moment. But it is not merely curious.
It is promptly helpful. There is some one to sit on
the head of the fallen horse,&mdash;a dozen hands to unbuckle
the harness; if a litter is needed for the
wounded man, it is quickly improvised, and he is
carried into the nearest shop, while some one sends a
&ldquo;hurry call&rdquo; for the doctor and the ambulance.</p>

<p>Until about forty years ago, the whole work of
fighting fire in the cities was left to voluntary
effort. Companies of citizens were formed, like
social or political clubs, which purchased fire-engines,
and organized themselves into a brigade
ready to come at the first alarm of a conflagration.
The crowd came with them and helped. I have seen
a church on Sunday morning emptied of all its able-bodied
young men by the ringing of the fire-bell.
It is true that there was a keen rivalry among these
voluntary fire-fighters which sometimes led them to
fight one another on their way to a conflagration.
But out of these free associations have grown the
paid fire-departments of the large cities, with their
fine tradition of courage and increased efficiency.</p>

<p>If you wish to see an American crowd in its most
extraordinary aspect, you should go to a political
convention for the nomination of a President. The
streets swarming with people, all hurrying in one
direction, talking loudly, laughing, cheering; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
vast, barn-like hall draped with red, white, and blue
bunting, and packed with 12,000 of the 200,000
folks who have tried to get into it; the thousand
delegates sitting together in solid cohorts according
to the States which they represent, each cohort ready
to shout and cheer and vote as one man for its
&ldquo;favourite son&rdquo;; the officers on the far-away platform,
Lilliputian figures facing, directing, dominating
this Brobdignagian mass of humanity; the buzzing
of the audience in the intervals of business; the
alternate waves of excitement and uneasiness that
sweep over it; the long speeches, the dull speeches,
the fiery speeches, the outbreaks of laughter and applause,
the coming and going of messengers, the
waving of flags and banners,&mdash;what does it all
mean? What reason or order is there in it? What
motives guide and control this big, good-natured
crowd?</p>

<p>Wait. You are at the Republican Convention in
Chicago. The leadership of Mr. Roosevelt in the
party is really the point in dispute, though not a
word has been said about it. A lean, clean-cut, incisive
man is speaking, the Chairman of the convention.
Presently he shoots out a sentence referring
to &ldquo;the best abused and the most popular man in
America.&rdquo; As if it were a signal given by a gun,
that phrase lets loose a storm, a tempest of applause
for Roosevelt,&mdash;cheers, yells, bursts of song, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
blowing of brass-bands, the roaring of megaphones,
the waving of flags; more cheers like volleys of
musketry; a hurricane of vocal enthusiasm, dying
down for a moment to break out in a new place,
redoubling itself in vigour as if it had just begun,
shaking the rafters and making the bunting flutter
in the wind. For forty-seven minutes by the clock
that American crowd pours out its concerted enthusiasm,
and makes a new &ldquo;record&rdquo; for the length of a
political demonstration.</p>

<p>Now change the scene to Denver, a couple of weeks
later. The Democrats are holding their convention.
You are in the same kind of a hall, only a little larger,
filled with the same kind of a crowd, only more of it.
The leadership of Mr. Bryan is the point in dispute,
and everybody knows it. Presently a speaker on the
platform mentions &ldquo;the peerless son of Nebraska&rdquo;
and pauses as if he expected a reply. It comes like
an earthquake. The crowd breaks into a long, indescribable,
incredible tumult of applause, just like
the other one, but lasting now for more than eighty
minutes,&mdash;a new &ldquo;record&rdquo; of demonstration.</p>

<p>What are these scenes at which you have assisted?
The meetings of two entirely voluntary associations
of American citizens, who have agreed to work together
for political purposes. And what are these
masses of people who are capable of cheering in
unison for three-quarters of an hour, or an hour and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
a quarter? Just two American crowds showing their
enthusiasm for their favourites.</p>

<p>What does it all prove?</p>

<p>Nothing,&mdash;I think,&mdash;except an extraordinary
capacity for self-organization.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the Spirit of America shows the sense of
common order in much deeper and more significant
things than the physical smoothing and polishing of
town and country, or than the behaviour of an average
crowd. It is of these more important things that
I wish to give some idea.</p>

<p>It has been said that the first instinct of the Americans,
confronted by a serious difficulty or problem,
is to appoint a committee and form a society.
Whether this be true or not, I am sure that many, if
not most, of the advances in moral and social order
in the United States during the last thirty or forty
years have been begun and promoted in this way.
It is, in fact, the natural way in a conservative republic.</p>

<p>Where public opinion rules, expressing itself more
or less correctly in popular suffrage, no real reform
can be accomplished without first winning the opinion
of the public in its favour. Those who believe in
the reform must get together in order to do this.
They must gather their evidence, present their arguments,
show why and how certain things ought to be
done, and urge the point until the public sees it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, in some cases, legislation follows. The
moral sense, or it may be merely the practical
common sense, <i>le gros bon sens de m&eacute;nage</i>, of the
community, takes shape in some formal statute or
enactment. A State or municipal board or commission
is appointed, and the reform passes from
the voluntary to the organic stage. The association
or committee which promoted it disappears in a
blaze of congratulation, or perhaps continues its
existence to watch the enforcement of the new laws.</p>

<p>But there is another class of cases in which no
formal legislation seems to be adequate to meet the
evils, or in which the process of law-making is impeded
or perhaps altogether prevented by the American
system of dividing the power between the national,
State, and local governments. Here the private
association of public-spirited citizens must act as a
compensating force in the body politic. It must take
what it can get in the way of partial organic reform,
and supply what is lacking by voluntary co&ouml;peration.</p>

<p>There is still a third class of evils which seem to
have their roots not in the structure of society, but
in human nature itself, and for these the typical
American believes that the only amelioration is a
steady and friendly effort by men of good-will.
He does not look for the establishment of the millennium
by statute. He does not think that the impersonal
State can strengthen character, bind up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
broken hearts, or be a nursing mother to the ignorant,
the wounded, and the helpless. For this work there
must always be a personal service, a volunteer service,
a service to which men and women are bound,
not by authority, but by the inward ties of philanthropy
and religion.</p>

<p>Now these three kinds of voluntary co&ouml;peration for
the bettering of the common order are not peculiar
to America. One finds them in every nation that has
the seed of progress in its mind or the vision of the
<i>civitas Dei</i> in its soul,&mdash;and nowhere more than in
France. The French have a genius for society and
a passion for societies. But I am not sure that they
understand how much the Americans resemble them
in the latter respect, and how much has been accomplished
in the United States by way of voluntary
social co&ouml;peration under an individualistic system.</p>

<p>Take the subject of hospitals. I was reading
the other day a statement by M. Jules Huret:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;At Pittsburg, the industrial hell, which contains 60,000
Italians, and 300,000 Slavs, Croats, Hungarians, etc., in the
city and its suburbs,&mdash;at Pittsburg, capital of the Steel Trust,
which distributes 700 millions of interest and dividends every
year,&mdash;there is no free hospital!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="noidt">This is wonderfully incorrect. There are thirty-three
hospitals at Pittsburgh, fifteen public and eighteen
private. In 1908, thirteen of these hospitals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
treated over ten thousand free patients, at a cost
of more than three hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>In New York there are more than forty hospitals,
of which six are municipal institutions, while the
others are incorporated by associations of citizens
and supported largely by benevolent gifts; and more
than forty free dispensaries for the treatment of
patients and the distribution of medicines. In fact,
the dispensaries increased so rapidly, a few years ago,
that the regular physicians complained that their
business was unfairly reduced. They said that prosperous
people went to the dispensary to save expense;
and they humbly suggested that no patient who wore
diamonds should be received for free treatment.</p>

<p>In the United States in 1903 there were 1500 hospitals
costing about $29,000,000 a year for maintenance:
$9,000,000 of this came from public funds,
and the remaining $20,000,000 from charitable gifts
and from paying patients. One-third of the patients
were in public institutions, the other two-thirds in
hospitals under private or religious control. There
is not a city of any consequence in America which is
without good hospital accommodations; and there
are few countries in the world where it is more comfortable
for a stranger to break a leg or have a mild attack
of appendicitis. All this goes to show that the
Americans recognize the care of the sick and wounded
as a part of the common order. They perceive that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the State never has been, and probably never will
be, able to do all that is needed without the help of
benevolent individuals, religious bodies, and philanthropic
societies.</p>

<p>How generously this help is given in America,
not only for hospitals, but for all other objects of
benevolence, may be seen from the fact that the
public gifts and bequests of private citizens for the
year 1907 amounted to more than $100,000,000.</p>

<p>Let me give another illustration of voluntary social
co&ouml;peration in this sphere of action which lies at
least in part beyond the reach of the State. In all
the American cities of large size, you will find institutions
which are called &ldquo;Settlements,&rdquo;&mdash;a vague
word which has been defined to mean &ldquo;homes in the
poorer quarters of a city where educated men and
women may live in daily contact with the working people.&rdquo;
The first house of this kind to be established
was Toynbee Hall in London, in 1885. Two years
later the Neighbourhood Guild was founded in New
York, and in 1889 the College Settlement in the same
city, and Hull House in Chicago, were established.
There are now reported some three hundred of such
settlement houses in the world, of which England
has 56, Holland 11, Scotland 10, France 4, Germany
2, and the United States 207. I will take, as
examples, Hull House in Chicago, and the Henry
Street Settlement in New York.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Hull House was started by two ladies who went
into one of the worst districts of Chicago and took
a house with the idea of making it a radiating centre
of orderly and happy life. Their friends backed them
up with money and help. After five years the enterprise
was incorporated. The buildings, which are of
the most substantial kind, now cover a whole city
block, some forty or fifty thousand square feet, and,
include an apartment house, a boys&rsquo; club, a girls&rsquo;
club, a theatre, a gymnasium, a day nursery, workshops,
class rooms, a coffee-house, and so on. There
are forty-four educated men and women in residence
who are engaged in self-supporting occupations, and
who give their free time to the work of the settlement.
A hundred and fifty outside helpers come
every week to serve as teachers, friendly visitors, or
directors of clubs: 9000 people a week come to the
house as members of some one of its organizations or
as parts of an audience. There are free concerts, and
lectures, and classes of various kinds in study and in
handicraft. Investigations of the social and industrial
conditions of the neighbourhood are carried on, not
officially, but informally; and the knowledge thus
obtained has been used not only for the visible
transformation of the region around Hull House,
but also to throw light upon the larger needs and
possibilities of improvement in Chicago and other
American cities. Hull House, in fact, is an example<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of ethical and humane housekeeping on a big scale
in a big town.</p>

<p>The Henry Street Settlement in New York is
quite different in its specific quality. It was begun
in 1893 by two trained nurses, who went down into
the tenement-house district, to find the sick and to
nurse them in their homes. At first they lived in a
tenement house themselves; then the growth of their
work and the coming of other helpers forced them to
get a little house, then another, and another, a cottage
in the country, a convalescent home. The idea
of the settlement was single and simple. It was to
meet the need of intelligent and skilful nursing in the
very places where dirt and ignorance, carelessness
and superstition, were doing the most harm,&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;in the crowded warrens of the poor.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">This little company of women, some twenty or thirty
of them, go about from tenement to tenement,
bringing cleanliness and order with them. In the
presence of disease and pain they teach lessons which
could be taught in no other way. They nurse five
or six thousand patients every year, and make forty
or fifty thousand visits. In addition to this, largely
through their influence and example, the Board of
Education has adopted a trained nursing service in
the public schools, and has appointed a special corps
of nurses to take prompt charge of cases of contagious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
disease among the school children. The Nurses&rsquo;
Settlement, in fact, is a repetition of the parable of the
Good Samaritan in a crowded city instead of on a
lonely road.</p>

<p>These two examples illustrate the kind of work
that is going on all over the United States. Every
religious body, Jewish or Christian, has some part in
it. It touches many sides of life,&mdash;this effort to do
for the common order what the State has never been
able to accomplish fully,&mdash;to sweeten and humanize
it. I wish that there were time to speak of some
particularly interesting features, like the Children&rsquo;s
Aid Society, the George Junior Republic, the Association
for Improving the Condition of the Poor, the
Kindergarten Association. But now I must pass at
once to the second kind of social effort, that in which
the voluntary co&ouml;peration of the citizen enlightens
and guides and supplements the action of the State.</p>

<p>Here I might speak of the great question of the
housing of the poor, and of the relation of private
building and loan associations to governmental
regulation of tenements and dwelling-houses. This
is one of the points on which America has lagged
behind the rest of the civilized world. Our excessive
spirit of <i>laissez-faire</i>, and our cheerful optimism,&mdash;which
in this case justifies the cynical definition of
optimism as &ldquo;an indifference to the sufferings of
others,&rdquo;&mdash;permitted the development in New York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
of the most congested and rottenly overcrowded
ten acres on the face of the habitable globe. But the
Tenement House Commission of 1894, and the other
commissions which followed it, did much to improve
conditions. A fairly good Tenement House Act was
passed. A special Department of the municipality
was created to enforce it. The dark interior rooms,
the vile and unsanitary holes, the lodgings without
water or air or fire-escapes, are being slowly but surely
broken up and extirpated, and a half-dozen private
societies, combining philanthropy with business, are
building decent houses for working people, which
return from 3 per cent to 5 per cent on the capital
invested.</p>

<p>For our present purpose, however, it will be better
to take an example which is less complicated,
and in which the co&ouml;peration of the State and the
good-will of the private citizen can be more closely
and simply traced. I mean the restriction and the
regulation of child labour.</p>

<p>Every intelligent nation sees in its children its
most valuable asset. That their physical and
moral development should be dwarfed or paralyzed
by bondage to exhausting and unwholesome labour,
or by a premature absorption in toil of any kind,
would be at once a national disgrace and a national
calamity.</p>

<p>Three kinds of societies have been and still are at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
work in America to prevent this shame and disaster.
First, there are the societies which are devoted to the
general protection of all the interests of the young,
like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children.</p>

<p>Then there are the societies which make their appeal
to the moral sense of the community to condemn
and suppress all kinds of inhumanity in the conduct
of industry and trade. Of these the Consumers&rsquo;
League is an example. Founded in New York in
1890, by a few ladies of public spirit, it has spread
to twenty other States, with sixty-four distinct societies
and a national organization for the whole country.
Its central idea is to persuade people, rich and poor,
to buy only those things which are made and sold
under fair and humane conditions. The responsibility
of men and women for the way in which they
spend their money is recognized. They are asked to
remember that the cheapness of a bargain is not the
only thing for them to consider. They ought to think
whether it has been made cheap at the cost of human
sorrow and degradation, whether the distress and
pain and exhaustion of overtasked childhood and
ill-treated womanhood have made their cheap bargain
a shameful and poisonous thing. The first work of
the leagues was to investigate the actual condition of
labour in the great stores. The law forbade them to
publish a <i>black list</i> of the establishments where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
employees were badly treated. That would have
been in the nature of a boycott. But they ingeniously
evaded this obstacle by publishing a <i>white list</i> of those
which treated their people decently and kindly.
Thus the standard of a &ldquo;<i>Fair House</i>&rdquo; where a living
wage was paid, where children of tender years were
not employed, where the hours of work were not excessive,
and where the sanitary conditions were good,
was established, and that standard has steadily been
raised.</p>

<p>Then the leagues went on to investigate the conditions
of production of the goods sold in the shops.
The National League issues a <i>white label</i> which
guarantees that every article upon which it is found
has been manufactured in a place where, (1) the
State factory law is obeyed, (2) no children under
sixteen years of age are employed, (3) no night work
is required and the working-day does not exceed ten
hours, (4) no goods are given out to be made away
from the factory. At the same time the Consumers&rsquo;
League has been steadily pressing the legislatures and
governors of the different States for stricter and better
laws in regard to the employment of women and
children.</p>

<p>The third class of societies which are at work in
this field are those which deal directly with the
question of child labour. It must be remembered
that under the American system this is a matter which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
is left to the control of the separate States. Naturally
there has been the greatest imaginable diversity
among them. For a long time there were many that
had practically no laws upon the subject, or laws
so defective that they were useless. Even now the
States are far from anything like harmony or equality
in their child-labour laws. Illinois, Massachusetts,
New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin are
probably in the lead in good legislation. If we may
judge by the statistics of children between ten and
fourteen years who are unable to read or write,
Tennessee, Mississippi, the Carolinas, Louisiana,
Georgia, and Alabama are in the rear.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, also, that the number of
children between ten and fifteen years employed in
manufacturing pursuits in the United States increased
from 1890 to 1900 more than twice as fast as the population
of the country, and that the Census of 1900
gives the total of bread-winners under fifteen years
of age as 1,750,000. A graphic picture of the actual
condition of child labour in the United States may
be found in <i>The Cry of the Children</i>, by Mrs.
John Van Vorst (New York, 1908).</p>

<p>Here is a little army&mdash;no, a vast army&mdash;of little
soldiers, whose sad and silent files are full of menace
for the republic.</p>

<p>The principal forces arrayed against this perilous
condition of things have been the special committees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
of the Women&rsquo;s Clubs everywhere, the Child-Labour
Committees in different States, and finally the National
Child-Labour Committee organized in 1904.
Through their efforts there has been a great advance
in legislation on the subject. In 1905, twenty-two
States enacted laws regulating the employment of
children. In 1906 there were six States which legislated,
including Georgia and Iowa, which for the first
time put a law against child labour on their statute-books.
In 1907 eight States amended their laws.
In the same year a national investigation of the subject
was ordered by Congress under direction of the
Federal Commissioner of Labour.</p>

<p>A bill was prepared which attempted to deal with
the subject indirectly through that provision of the
Constitution which gives Congress the power to
&ldquo;regulate commerce.&rdquo; This bill proposed to make
it unlawful to transport from one State to another the
product of any factory or mine in which children under
fourteen years of age were employed. It was a
humane and ingenious device. But it is doubtful
whether it can ever be made an effective law. The
best judges think that it stretches the idea of the
regulation of interstate commerce beyond reasonable
limits, and that the national government has no power
to control industrial production in the separate States
without an amendment to the Constitution. If this
be true (and I am inclined to believe it is), then the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
best safeguard of America against the evils of child
labour must be persistent action of these private associations
in each community, investigating and reporting
the actual conditions, awakening and stimulating
the local conscience, pushing steadily for better State
laws, and, when they are enacted, still working to
create a public sentiment which will enforce them.</p>

<p>It is one thing to love your own children and care
for them. It is another thing to have a wise, tender,
protecting regard for all the children of your country.
We wish and hope to see better and more uniform
laws against child labour in America. But, after all,
nothing can take the place of the sentiment of fatherhood
and motherhood in patriotism. And that
comes and stays only through the voluntary effort
of men and women of good-will.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last sphere in which the sense of common
order in America has been expressed and promoted
by social co&ouml;peration is that of direct and definite
reform accomplished by legislation, as a result, at
least in part, of the work of some society or committee,
formed for that specific purpose. Here a small,
but neat, illustration is at hand.</p>

<p>For many years America practised, and indeed
legally sanctioned, the habit of literary piracy.
Foreign authors were distinctly refused any protection
in the United States for the fruit of their intellectual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
labours. A foreigner might make a hat, and no one
could steal it. He might cultivate a crop of potatoes,
and no one could take them from him without paying
for them. But let him write a book, and any one
could reprint it, and sell it, and make a fortune out
of it, without being compelled to give the unhappy
author a penny. American authors felt the shame
of this state of things,&mdash;and the disorder, too, for it
demoralized the book-trade and brought a mass of
stolen goods into cheap competition with those which
had paid an honest royalty to their makers. A
Copyright League was formed which included all the
well-known writers of America. After years of hard
work this league secured the passage of an international
copyright law which gave the same protection
to the foreigner as to the American author, providing
only, under the protective tariff system, that his
book must be printed and manufactured in the
United States.</p>

<p>But the most striking and important example
of this kind of work is that of the Civil Service Reform
Association, which was organized in 1877. Here
a few words of explanation are necessary.</p>

<p>In the early history of the United States the
number of civil offices under the national government
was comparatively small, and the appointments
were generally made for ability and fitness. But as
the country grew, the number of offices increased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
with tremendous rapidity. By 1830 the so-called
&lsquo;Spoils System&rsquo; which regarded them as prizes of political
war, to be distributed by the successful party
in each election for the reward and encouragement of
its adherents, became a fixed idea in the public mind.
The post-offices, the custom-houses, all departments
of the civil service, were treated as rich treasuries of
patronage, and used first by the Democrats and then
by the Republicans, to consolidate and perpetuate
partisan power.</p>

<p>It was not a question of financial corruption, of
bribery with money. It was worse. It was a question
of the disorder and impurity of the national
housekeeping, of the debauchment and degradation
of the daily business of the State.</p>

<p>Notoriously unfit persons were appointed to responsible
positions. The tenure of office was brief
and insecure. Every presidential election threatened
to make a clean sweep of the hundreds of thousands
of people who were doing the necessary routine
work of the nation. Federal office-holders were
practically compelled to contribute to campaign
expenses, and to work and fight, like a host of mercenaries,
for the success of the party which kept
them in place. Confusion and inefficiency prevailed
everywhere.</p>

<p>In 1871 the condition of affairs had become intolerable.
President Grant, in his first term, recom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>mended
legislation, and appointed a national civil
service commission, with George William Curtis at
its head. Competitive examinations were begun,
and a small appropriation was made to carry on
the work. But the country was not yet educated
up to the reform. Congress was secretly and stubbornly
opposed to it. The appropriation was withdrawn.
The work of the commission was ridiculed,
and in his second term, in 1875, Grant was obliged
to give it up.</p>

<p>Then the Civil Service Reform Association, with
men like George William Curtis, Carl Schurz,
Dorman B. Eaton, and James Russell Lowell as its
leaders, was organized. A vigorous and systematic
campaign of public agitation and education was
begun. Candidates for the Presidency and other
elective offices were called to declare their policy on
this question.</p>

<p>The war of opinion was fierce. The assassination
of President Garfield, in 1881, was in some measure
due to the feeling of hostility aroused by his known
opposition to the Spoils System. His successor,
Vice-President Arthur, who was supposed to be a
spoilsman, surprised everybody by his loyalty to
Garfield&rsquo;s policy on this point. And in 1883 a bill
for the reform of the Civil Service was passed and a
new commission appointed. The next President
was Grover Cleveland, an ardent and fearless friend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of the reform, who greatly increased its practical
efficiency. He fought against Congress, both in his
first and in his second term, to enlarge the scope
and operation of the act by bringing more offices
into the classified and competitive service. In his
second term, by executive order, he increased the
number of classified positions from forty-three thousand
to eighty-seven thousand.</p>

<p>Presidents Harrison and McKinley worked in the
same direction. And President Roosevelt, whose
first national office was that of Civil Service Commissioner
from 1889 to 1895, has raised and strengthened
the rules, and applied the merit system to the
consular service and other important departments
of governmental work.</p>

<p>The result is that out of three hundred and twenty-five
thousand positions in the executive civil service
one hundred and eighty-five thousand are now classified,
and appointments are made either under competitive
examination or on the merit system for proved
efficiency. This is an immense forward step in the
promotion of common order, and it is largely the
result of the work of the Civil Service Reform
Association, acting upon the formation of public
opinion. I believe it would be impossible for any
candidate known to favour the Spoils System to be
elected to the Presidency of the United States
to-day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>A moment of thought will show the bearing of
this illustration upon the subject which we are now
considering. Here was a big, new, democratic
people, self-reliant and sovereign, prosperous to a
point where self-complacency was almost inevitable,
and grown quite beyond the reach of external correction
and control. They had fallen into wretched
habits of national housekeeping. Their domestic
service was disorderly and incompetent. The party
politicians, on both sides, were interested in maintaining
this bad service, because they made a profit
out of it. The people had been hardened to it; they
seemed to be either careless and indifferent, in their
large, happy-go-lucky way, or else positively attached
to a system which stirred everything up every
four years and created unlimited opportunities for
office-seeking and salary-drawing. What power
could save them from their own bad judgment?</p>

<p>There was no higher authority to set them right.
Everything was in their own hands. The case looked
hopeless. But in less than thirty years the voluntary
effort of a group of clear-sighted and high-minded
citizens changed everything. An appeal to the
sense of common order, of decency, of propriety,
in the soul of the people created a sentiment which
was too strong for the selfish politicians of either
party to resist. The popular will was enlightened,
converted, transformed, and an orderly, just, business-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>like
administration of the Civil Service became, if
not an accomplished fact, at least a universal and
acknowledged aim of national desire and effort.</p>

<p>It is to precisely the same source that we must
look with hope for the further development of harmony,
and social equilibrium, and efficient civic
righteousness, in American affairs. It is by precisely
the same process that America must save herself
from the perils and perplexities which are inherent in
her own character and in the form of government
which she has evolved to fit it.</p>

<p>That boastful self-complacency which is the caricature
of self-reliance, that contempt for the minority
which is the mockery of fair play, that stubborn personal
lawlessness which is the bane of the strong will
and the energetic temperament, can be restrained,
modified, corrected, and practically conquered, only
by another inward force,&mdash;the desire of common order,
the instinct of social co&ouml;peration. And there is
no way of stimulating this desire, of cultivating this
instinct, at least for the American republic, except the
way of voluntary effort and association among the
men and women of good-will.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One looks with amazement upon the vast array
of &ldquo;societies&rdquo; of all kinds which have sprung into
being in the United States during the last thirty years.
They cover every subject of social thought and en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>deavour.
Their documents and pamphlets and circulars
fill the mails. Their appeals for contributions
and dues tax the purse. To read all that they print
would be a weariness to the flesh. To attend all their
meetings and conferences would wreck the most robust
listener. To speak at all of them would ruin the
most fluent orator. A feeling of humorous discouragement
and dismay often comes over the quiet man
who contemplates this astonishing phase of American
activity.</p>

<p>But if he happens also to be a conscientious man, he
is bound to remember, on the other side, that the
majority of these societies exist for some practical
end which belongs to the common order. The
Women&rsquo;s Clubs, all over the country, have been
powerful promoters of local decency and good legislation.
The Leagues for Social Service, for Political
Education, for Municipal Reform, have investigated
conditions, collected facts, and acted as &ldquo;clearing-houses
for human betterment.&rdquo; The White Ribbon,
and Red Ribbon, and Blue Ribbon Clubs have
worked for purity and temperance. The Prison Associations
have sought to secure the treatment of
criminals as human beings. The City Clubs, and
Municipal Leagues, and Vigilance Societies have
acted as unpaid watchmen over the vital interests of
the great cities. The Medical and Legal Societies
have used their influence in behalf of sanitary reform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
and the improvement of the machinery and methods
of the courts.</p>

<p>There is no subject affecting the common welfare
on which Congress would venture to legislate to-day
until the committee to which the bill had been referred
had first given a public hearing. At these
hearings, which are open to all, the societies that are
interested present their facts and arguments, and
plead their cause.</p>

<p>Even associations of a less serious character seem
to recognize their civic responsibilities. The Society
of the Sons of the Revolution prints and distributes,
in a dozen different languages, a moral and patriotic
pamphlet of &ldquo;Information for Immigrants.&rdquo; The
Sportsmen&rsquo;s Clubs take an active interest in the improvement
and enforcement of laws for the protection
of fish and game. The Audubon Societies in
many parts of the country have stopped, or at least
checked, the extermination of wild birds of beauty and
song for the supposed adornment of women&rsquo;s hats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that there are still many and
grave defects in the common order of America. For
example, when a bitter and prolonged conflict between
organized capital and organized labour paralyzes
some necessary industry, we have no definite and
sure way of protecting that great third party, the helpless
consuming public. In the coal strike, a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
years ago, the operators and the workmen were at a
deadlock, and there was a good prospect that many
people would freeze to death. But President Roosevelt,
with the approval of men like ex-President
Cleveland, forced or persuaded the two warring
parties to go on with the mining of coal, while a committee
of impartial arbitration settled their dispute.</p>

<p>We have no uniformity in our game laws, our forestry
laws, our laws for the preservation and purity
of the local water-supply. As these things are left to
the control of the separate States, it will be very difficult
to bring them all into harmony and good order.</p>

<p>The same thing is true of a much more important
matter,&mdash;the laws of marriage and divorce. Each
State and Territory has its own legislation on this
subject. In consequence there are fifty-one distinct
divorce codes in the United States and their Territories.
South Carolina grants no divorce; New
York and North Carolina admit only one cause; New
Hampshire admits fourteen. In some of the States,
like South Dakota, a legal residence of six months is
sufficient to qualify a person to sue for a divorce;
and those States have always a transient colony of
people who are anxious to secure a rapid separation.</p>

<p>The provisions in regard to re-marriage are various
and confusing. A man who is divorced under
the law of South Dakota and marries again can
be convicted of bigamy in New York.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>All this is immensely disorderly and demoralizing.
The latest statistics which are accessible show that
there were 25,000 divorces in the United States in the
year 1886. The annual number at present is estimated
at nearly 60,000.</p>

<p>But the work which is being done by the National
League for the Protection of the Family, and the
united efforts of the churches, which have been deeply
impressed with the need of awakening and elevating
public sentiment on this subject, have already produced
an improvement in many States. It is possible
that a much greater uniformity of legislation may be
reached, even though a national law may not be
feasible. It is certain that the effective protection of
the family must be secured in America, as elsewhere,
by a social education and co&ouml;peration which will
teach men and women to think of the whole subject
&ldquo;reverently, soberly, and in the fear of God, duly
considering the causes for which marriage was
ordained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this, and in all other things of like nature, we
Americans look into the future not without misgivings
and fears, but with an underlying confidence that the
years will bring a larger and nobler common order,
and that the Republic will be peace.</p>

<p>In the minor problems we shall make many mistakes.
In the great problems, in the pressing emer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>gencies,
we rely upon the moral power in reserve.
The sober soul of the people is neither frivolous nor
fanatical. It is earnest, ethical, desirous of the common
good, responsive to moral appeal, capable of
self-control, and, in the time of need, strong for self-sacrifice.
It has its hours of illusion, its intervals of
indifference and drowsiness. But while there are
men and women passionately devoted to its highest
ideals, and faithful in calling it to its duties, it will not
wholly slumber nor be lost in death.</p>

<p>If there is to be an American aristocracy, it shall not
be composed of the rich, nor of those whose only pride
is in their ancient name, but of those who have done
most to keep the Spirit of America awake and eager
to solve the problems of the common order, of those
who have spoken to her most clearly and steadily, by
word and deed, reminding her that</p>

<h2>VI<br />

PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND
EDUCATION</h2>


<p>The Spirit of America shows its ingrained individualism
nowhere more clearly than in education.
First, by the breadth of the provision which it makes,
up to a certain point, for everybody who wishes to
be educated. Second, by the entire absence of anything
like a centralized control of education. Third,
by the remarkable evolution of different types of
educational institutions and the liberty of choice
which they offer to each student.</p>

<p>All this is in the nature of evidence to the existence
of a fifth quality in the Spirit of America, closely connected
with the sense of self-reliance and a strong will-power,
intimately related to the love of fair play and
common order,&mdash;a keen appreciation of <i>the value of
personal development</i>.</p>

<p>Here again, as in the previous lectures, what we
have to observe and follow is not a logical syllogism,
nor a geometrical proposition neatly and accurately
worked out. It is a natural process of self-realization.
It is the history of the soul of a people learning how
to think for itself. As in government, in social
order, in organized industry, so in education, America<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
has followed, not the line of least resistance, nor the
line of abstract doctrine, but the line of vital impulse.</p>

<p>And whence did this particular impulse spring?
From a sense of the real value of knowledge to man
as man. From a conviction that there is no natural
right more precious than the right of the mind to
grow. From a deep instinct of prudence reminding a
nation in which the people are the sovereign that it
must attend to &ldquo;the education of the prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These are the feelings and convictions, very plain
and primitive in their nature, which were shared
by the real makers of America, and which have ever
since controlled her real leaders. They are in striking
contrast with the views expressed by some of the
strangers who were sent out in early times to govern
the colonies; as, for example, that Royal Governor
Berkeley who, writing home to England from Virginia
in the seventeenth century, thanked God that
&ldquo;no public schools nor printing-presses existed in the
colony,&rdquo; and added his &ldquo;hope that they would not be
introduced for a hundred years, since learning brings
irreligion and disobedience into the world, and the
printing-press disseminates them and fights against
the best intentions of the government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this Governor Berkeley was of a different type
from that Bishop Berkeley who came to the western
world to establish a missionary training-school, and,
failing in that, gave his real estate at Newport and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
library of a thousand books to the infant Yale College
at New Haven; of a different type from those Dutch
colonists of New Amsterdam who founded the first
American public school in 1621; of a different type
from those Puritan colonists of Massachusetts Bay
who established the Boston Latin School in 1635 and
Harvard College in 1636; of a different type from
Franklin, who founded the Philadelphia Circulating
Library in 1731, the American Philosophical Society
in 1744, and the Academy of Pennsylvania in 1749;
of a different type from Washington, who urged the
foundation of a national university and left property
for its endowment by his last will and testament;
of a different type from Jefferson, who desired to have
it recorded upon his tombstone that he had rendered
three services to his country&mdash;the framing of the
Declaration of Independence, the establishment of
religious liberty in Virginia, and the founding of
the University of that State.</p>

<p>Among the men who were most responsible,
from the beginning, for the rise and growth and continuance
of the spirit of self-reliance and fair play,
of active energy and common order in America, there
was hardly one who did not frequently express his conviction
that the spread of public intelligence was necessary
to these ends. Among those who have been
most influential in the guidance of the republic,
nothing is more remarkable than their agreement in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the opinion that education, popular and special, is
friendly to republican institutions.</p>

<p>This agreement is not a mere formal adherence to
an academic principle learned in the same school.
For there has been the greatest possible difference
in the schooling of these men. Adams, Jefferson,
Madison, Monroe, Hamilton, Webster, Hayes, Garfield,
Harrison, Roosevelt, had a college training;
Washington, Franklin, Marshall, Jackson, Van
Buren, Clay, Lincoln, Cleveland, McKinley, did not.</p>

<p>The sincere respect for education which is typical
of the American spirit is not a result of education.
It is a matter of intuitive belief, of mental character,
of moral temperament. First of all, the sure conviction
that every American child ought to have the
chance to go to school, to learn to read, to write, to
think; second, the general notion that it is both fair
and wise to make an open way for every one who is
talented and ambitious to climb as far as he can and
will in the higher education; third, the vague feeling
that it will be to the credit and benefit of democracy
not only to raise the average level of intelligence, but
also to produce men and institutions of commanding
excellence in learning and science and philosophy,&mdash;these
are the three elements which you will find
present in varying degrees in the views of typical
Americans in regard to education.</p>

<p>I say that you will find these elements in varying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
degrees, because there has been, and there still is,
some divergence of opinion as to the comparative emphasis
to be laid on these three points&mdash;the schoolhouse
door open to everybody, the college career open
to all the talents, and the university providing unlimited
opportunities for the disinterested pursuit of
knowledge.</p>

<p>Which is the most important? How far may the
State go in promoting the higher education? Is it
right to use the public funds, contributed by all the
taxpayers, for the special advantage of those who
have superior intellectual powers? Where is the line
to be drawn between the education which fits a boy
for citizenship, and that which merely gratifies his
own tastes or promotes his own ambition?</p>

<p>These are questions which have been seriously,
and, at times, bitterly debated in America. But,
meantime, education has gone steadily and rapidly
forward. The little public school of New Amsterdam
has developed into an enormous common-school
system covering the United States and all their Territories.
The little Harvard College at Cambridge has
become the mother of a vast brood of institutions,
public and private, which give all kinds of instruction,
philosophical, scientific, literary, and technical, and
which call themselves colleges or universities according
to their own fancy and will.</p>

<p>A foreigner visiting the country for the first time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
might well think it had a touch of academic mania.
A lecturer invited to describe the schools and colleges
of the United States in a single discourse might well
feel as embarrassed as that famous diplomat to whom
his companion at dinner said, between the soup and
the fish, &ldquo;I am so glad to meet you, for now you can
tell me all about the Far Eastern Question and make
me understand it.&rdquo; Let me warn you against expecting
anything of that kind in this lecture. I am
at least well enough educated to know that it is impossible
to tell all about American education in an
hour. The most that I can hope to do is to touch on
three points:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, the absence of centralized control and the
process of practical unification in educational work
in the United States.</p>

<p>Second, the growth and general character of the
common schools as an expression of the Spirit of
America.</p>

<p>Third, the relation of the colleges, universities, and
technical institutes to the life of the republic.</p>

<p>I. First, it should be distinctly understood and
remembered that there is absolutely <i>no national system
of education in America</i>.</p>

<p>The government at Washington has neither power
nor responsibility in regard to it. There is no Ministry
of Public Instruction; there are no Federal Inspectors;
there is no regulation from the centre.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
The whole thing is local and voluntary to a degree
which must seem to a Frenchman incomprehensible
if not reprehensible. In consequence it is both simple
and complicated,&mdash;simple in its practical working,
and extremely complicated in its general aspect.</p>

<p>The reasons for this lack of a national system and a
centralized control are not far to seek. In the first
place, at the time when the Union was formed, many
different European influences were already at work
fostering different educational ideals in various parts
of the country. No doubt the English influence was
predominant, especially in New England. Harvard
College at Cambridge in Massachusetts may be
regarded as the legitimate child of Emmanuel
College at Cambridge in England. But the development
of free common schools, especially in the Middle
States, was more largely affected by the example of
Holland, France, and Switzerland than by England.
The Presbyterians of New Jersey, when they founded
Princeton College in 1746, naturally turned to Scotland
for a model.</p>

<p>In Virginia, through Thomas Jefferson, a strong
French influence was felt. A Frenchman, Quesnay,
who had fought in the American army of the Revolution,
proposed to establish a National Academy of
Arts and Sciences in Richmond, with branches at
Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York, to give
advanced instruction in all branches of human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
learning. He had the approval of many of the best
people in France and Virginia, and succeeded in
raising 60,000 francs towards the endowment. The
corner-stone of a building was laid, and one professor
was chosen. But the scheme failed, because, in 1786,
both America and France were busy and poor.
Jefferson&rsquo;s plan for the University of Virginia, which
was framed on French lines, was put into successful
operation in 1825.</p>

<p>It would have been impossible at any time in the
early history of the United States&mdash;indeed, I think
it would be impossible now&mdash;to get a general agreement
among the friends of education in regard to the
form and method of a national system.</p>

<p>Another obstacle to a national system was the
fact that the colleges founded before the Revolution&mdash;William
and Mary, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
Columbia&mdash;were practically supported and controlled
by different churches&mdash;Congregational, Presbyterian,
or Episcopalian. Churches are not easy to
combine.</p>

<p>Still another obstacle, and a more important one,
was the sentiment of local independence, the spirit of
home rule which played such a prominent part in the
<i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> of the American drama. Each of the
distinct States composing the Union was tenacious of
its own individuality, and jealous of the local rights
by which alone that individuality could be preserved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
The most significant and potent of these rights was
that of educating the children and youth of the
community.</p>

<p>The States which entered the Union later brought
with them the same feeling of local pride and responsibility.
Ohio with its New England traditions,
Kentucky with its Southern traditions, Michigan
with its large infusion of French blood and thought,
Wisconsin with its vigorous German and Scandinavian
element,&mdash;each of these communities felt
competent and in honour bound to attend to its own
educational affairs. So far as the establishment and
control of schools, colleges, and universities is concerned,
every State of the Union is legally as independent
of all the other States as if they were separate
European countries like France and Germany and
Switzerland. Therefore, we may say that the American
system of education is not to have a system.</p>

<p>But if we stop here, we rest upon one of those half-truths
which are so dear to the pessimist and the
satirist. The bare statement that there is no national
system of education in America by no means exhausts
the subject. Taken by itself, it gives a false
impression. Abstract theory and formal regulation
are not the only means of unification. Nature and
human nature have their own secrets for creating
unity in diversity. This is the process which has been
at work in American education.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>First of all, there has been a general agreement
among the States in regard to the vital necessity
of education in a republic. The constitution of
Massachusetts, adopted in 1780, reads thus: &ldquo;Wisdom
and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally
among the people, being necessary for the
preservation of their rights and liberties; and as these
depend on spreading the opportunities and advantages
of education in the various parts of the country,
and among the different orders of the people, it shall
be the duty of legislatures and magistrates, in all
future periods of this Commonwealth, to cherish the
interests of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries
of them, especially the university at Cambridge,
public schools, and grammar schools in the towns; to
encourage private societies and public institutions,
rewards and immunities, for the promotion of agriculture,
arts, sciences, commerce, trades, manufactures,
and a natural history of the country; to countenance
and inculcate the principles of humanity and general
benevolence, public and private charity, industry and
frugality, honesty and punctuality, in their dealings,
sincerity, good humour, and all social affections and
generous sentiments among the people.&rdquo; After such
a sentence, one needs to take breath. It is a full
programme of American idealism, written in the
English of the eighteenth century, when people had
plenty of time. The new constitution of North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Carolina adopted in 1868 puts the same idea in terse
modern style: &ldquo;The people have the right to the
privilege of education, and it is the duty of the State
to guard and maintain that right.&rdquo; You will find
the same principle expressed in the constitutions of
all the American commonwealths.</p>

<p>In the next place, the friendly competition and
rivalry among the States produced a tendency to
unity in education. No State wished to be left behind.
The Southern States, which for a long time
had neglected the matter of free common schools,
were forced by the growth of illiteracy, after the
Civil War, to provide for the schooling of all their
children at public expense. The Western States, coming
into the Union one by one, had a feeling of pride
in offering to their citizens facilities for education
which should be at least equal to those offered in
&ldquo;the effete East.&rdquo; It is worthy of note that the most
flourishing State Universities now are west of the
Alleghanies. The only States which have more than
90 per cent of the children from five to eighteen years
of age enrolled in the common schools are Colorado,
Nevada, Idaho, and Washington,&mdash;all in the far
West.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the free intercourse and exchange of
population between the States have made for unity
in the higher education. Methods which have
proved successful in one community have been imi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>tated
and adopted in others. Experiments tried at
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, or Columbia have been
repeated in the West and South. Teachers trained in
the older colleges have helped to organize and develop
the new ones.</p>

<p>Nor has this process of assimilation been confined
to American ideas and models. European methods
have been carefully studied and adapted to the needs
and conditions of the United States. I happen to
know of a new Institute of Technology which has
been recently founded in Texas by a gift of eight
millions of dollars. The president-elect is a scientific
man who has already studied in France and Germany
and achieved distinction in his department. But
before he touches the building and organization of his
new Institute, he is sent to Europe for a year to see the
oldest and the newest and the best that has been done
there. In fact, the Republic of Learning to-day is the
true Cosmopolis. It knows no barriers of nationality.
It seeks truth and wisdom everywhere, and wherever
it finds them, it claims them for its own.</p>

<p>The spirit of voluntary co&ouml;peration for the promotion
of the common order, of which I spoke in a previous
lecture, has made itself felt in education by the
formation of Teachers&rsquo; Associations in the various
States, and groups of States, and by the foundation
of the National Educational Association, a voluntary
body incorporated in the District of Columbia, &ldquo;to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
elevate the character and advance the interests of the
profession of teaching, and to promote the cause of
education in the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally, while there is no national centre of authority
for education in the United States, there is a strong
central force of encouragement and enlightenment.
The Federal Government shows its interest in
education in several ways: First, in the enormous
grants of public lands which it has made from the
beginning for the endowment of common schools
and higher institutions in the various States.</p>

<p>Second, in the control and support of the United
States Military Academy at West Point, the Naval
Academy at Annapolis, the Indian Schools, the
National Museum, and the Congressional Library,
and in the provision which it makes for agricultural
and mechanical schools in different parts
of the country. The annual budget for these purposes
runs from twelve to twenty millions of dollars
a year.</p>

<p>Third, in the establishment of a National Bureau
of Education which collects statistics and information
and distributes reports on all subjects connected with
the educational interests of America. The Commissioner
at the head of this bureau is a man of high
standing and scholarship. He is chosen without
reference to politics, and holds his office independent
of party. He has no authority to make appointments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
or regulations. But he has a large influence, through
the light which he throws upon the actual condition of
education, in promoting the gradual and inevitable
process of unification.</p>

<p>Let me try to sum up what I have been saying on
this difficult subject of the lack of system and the
growth of unity in American education. There is
no organization from the centre. But there is a distinct
organization from the periphery,&mdash;if I may use
a scientific metaphor of such an unscientific character.
The formative principle is the development of the
individual.</p>

<p>What, then, does the average American boy find
in this country to give him a series of successive opportunities
to secure this personal development of mental
and moral powers?</p>

<p>First, a public primary school and grammar school
which will give him the rudiments of learning from
his sixth to his fourteenth year. Then a public
high school which will give him about what a French
<i>lyc&eacute;e</i> gives from his fourteenth to his eighteenth year.
He is now ready to enter the higher education. Up
to this point, if he lives in a town of any considerable
size, he has not been obliged to go away from home.
Many of the smaller places of three or four thousand
inhabitants have good high schools. If he lives in the
country, he may have had to go to the nearest city or
large town for his high school or academy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond this point, he finds either a college, as it is
called in America, or the collegiate department in one
of the universities, which will give him a four years&rsquo;
course of general study. Before he can begin this,
he must pass what is called an entrance examination,
which is practically uniform in all the better institutions,
and almost, but perhaps not quite, equivalent
to the examination in France for the degree of <i>bachelier</i>.
Thus a certain standard of preparation is set
for all the secondary schools. It is at the end of his
general course in literature, science, and philosophy
that the American student gets his bachelor&rsquo;s degree,
which corresponds pretty nearly to the French
degree of <i>licenci&eacute;</i> in letters and sciences.</p>

<p>Now the student, a young man of about twenty-one
or twenty-two years, is supposed to be prepared,
either to go into the world as a fairly well-educated
citizen, or to continue his studies for a professional
career. He finds the graduate schools of the universities
ready to give him courses which lead to the
degree of M.A. or Ph.D., and prepare him for the
higher kind of teaching. The schools of law and
medicine and engineering offer courses of from two
to four years with a degree of LL.B. or M.D. or C.E.
or M.E. at the end of them. The theological seminaries
are ready to instruct him for the service of the
church in a course of three or four years.</p>

<p>By this time he is twenty-four or twenty-five years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
old. Unless he has special ambitions which lead him
to study abroad, or to take up original research at
Johns Hopkins, Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, or some
other specially equipped university, he is now ready
for practical work. The American theory is that he
should go to work and get the rest of his education
in practice.</p>

<p>Of course there have been short cuts and irregular
paths open to him all along the way,&mdash;a short cut
from the high school to the technical school,&mdash;a
short cut into law or medicine by the way of private
preparation for the examination, which in some
States is absurdly low. But these short cuts are
being closed up very rapidly. It is growing more and
more difficult to get into a first-class professional
school without a collegiate or university degree.
Already, if the American student wants system and
regularity, he can get a closely articulated course,
fitted to his individual needs, from the primary school
up to the door of his profession.</p>

<p>But the real value of that course depends upon
two things that are beyond the power of any system
to insure&mdash;the personal energy that he brings to his
work, and the personal power of the professors under
whom he studies. I suppose the same thing is true
in France as in America. Neither here nor there can
you find equality of results. All you have a right to
expect is equality of opportunity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>II. The great symbol and instrument of this idea
of equal opportunity in the United States is the common
school. In every State of the Union provision
is made for the education of the children at public
expense. The extent and quality of this education,
the methods of control, the standards of equipment,
even the matter of compulsory or voluntary attendance,
vary in different States and communities.
But, as a rule, you may say that it puts within the
reach of every boy and girl free instruction from the
<i>a</i>-<i>b</i>-<i>c</i> up to the final grade of a <i>lyc&eacute;e</i>.</p>

<p>The money expended by the States on these
common schools in 1905-1906 was $307,765,000,&mdash;more
than one-third of the annual expenditure of the
national government for all purposes, more than
twice as much as the State governments spent for
all other purposes. This sum, you understand, was
raised by direct, local taxation. Neither the import
duties nor the internal revenue contributed anything
to it. It came directly from the citizen&rsquo;s pocket, at
the rate of $3.66 a year <i>per capita</i>, or nearly $13 a
year for every grown-up man.</p>

<p>How many children were benefited by it? Who
can tell? 16,600,000 boys and girls were enrolled in
the public schools (that is to say, more than 70 per
cent of the whole number of children between five
and eighteen years of age, and about 20 per cent of
the total population). The teachers employed were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
109,000 men, 356,000 women. The average daily
expenditure for each pupil was 17 cents; the average
annual expenditure, about $25.</p>

<p>In addition to this number there are at least 1,500,000
children in privately endowed and supported
schools, secular or religious. The Catholic Church
has a system of parochial schools which is said to
provide for about a million children. Many of the
larger Protestant Churches support high schools and
academies of excellent quality. Some of the most
famous secondary schools, like Phillips Exeter and
Andover, St. Paul&rsquo;s, the Hill School, Lawrenceville
School, are private foundations well endowed.</p>

<p>These figures do not mean much to the imagination.
Statistics are like grapes in their skins.
You have to put a pressure upon them to extract any
wine. Observe, then, that if you walked through an
American town between eight and nine in the morning,
and passed a thousand people indoors and out,
more than two hundred of them would be children
going to school. Perhaps twenty of these children
would turn in at private schools, or church schools.
But nine-tenths of the little crowd would be on their
way to the public schools. The great majority of
the children would be under fourteen years of age;
for only about one child out of every twenty goes beyond
that point in schooling. Among the younger
children the boys would outnumber the girls a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
little. But in the small group of high-school children
there would be three girls to two boys, because the
boys have to go to work earlier to earn a living.</p>

<p>Suppose you followed one of these groups of children
into the school, what would you find? That
would depend entirely upon local circumstances.
You might find a splendid building with modern
fittings; you might find an old-fashioned building,
overcrowded and ill-fitted. Each State, as I have
said before, has its own common-school system.
And not only so, but within the State there are smaller
units of organization&mdash;the county, the township, the
school district. Each of these may have its own
school board, conservative or progressive, generous
or stingy, and the quality and equipment of the
schools will vary accordingly. They represent pretty
accurately the general enlightenment and moral
tone of the community.</p>

<p>Wealth has something to do with it, of course.
People cannot spend money unless they have it.
The public treasury is not a Fortunatus&rsquo; purse which
fills itself. In the remote country districts, the little
red schoolhouse, with its single room, its wooden
benches, its iron stove, its unpainted flagstaff, stands
on some hill-top without a tree to shadow it, in brave,
unblushing poverty. In the richer cities there are
common school palaces with an aspect of splendour
which is almost disconcerting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet it is not altogether a question of wealth. It is
also a question of public spirit. Baltimore is nearly
as large and half as rich as Boston, yet Boston spends
about three times as much on her schools. Richmond
has about the same amount of taxable property
as Rochester, N.Y., yet Richmond spends only one-quarter
as much on her schools. Houston, Texas;
Wilmington, Delaware; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania;
Trenton, New Jersey; New Bedford, Massachusetts;
and Des Moines, Iowa, are six cities with a population
of from 80,000 to 100,000 each, and not far apart in
wealth. But their public-school bills in 1906 varied
as follows: Des Moines, $492,000; New Bedford,
$472,000; Harrisburg, $304,000; Trenton, $300,000;
Wilmington, $226,000; and Houston, the
richest of the six, $163,000.</p>

<p>If you should judge from this that the public
schools are most liberally supported in the North
Atlantic, North Central, and Far Western States,
you would be right. The amount that is contributed
to the common schools per adult male inhabitant
is largest in the following States in order:
Utah, $22; North Dakota, $21; New York, $20;
Colorado, $20; Massachusetts, $19; South Dakota,
$19; Nebraska, $17; and Pennsylvania, $16. The
comparative weakness of the common schools in the
South Atlantic and South Central States has led to the
giving of large sums of money by private benevolence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
the Peabody Fund, the Slater Fund, the Southern
Education Fund, which are administered by boards
of trustees for the promotion of education in
these backward regions. The Spirit of America
strongly desires to spread, to improve, to equalize
and co&ouml;rdinate, the public schools of the whole
country.</p>

<p>Is it succeeding? What lines is it following?
Where are the changes most apparent?</p>

<p>First of all, there is a marked advance in the physical
equipment of the common school. In the villages
and in the rural districts the new buildings are larger
and more commodious than the old ones. In many
parts of the country the method of concentration is
employed. Instead of half a dozen poor little schoolhouses
scattered over the hills, one good house is built
in a central location, and the children are gathered
from the farmhouses by school omnibuses or by
the electric trolley-cars. Massachusetts made a law
in 1894 requiring every township which did not have
a high school to pay the transportation expenses of all
qualified pupils who wished to attend the high schools
of neighbouring towns.</p>

<p>In many States text-books are provided at the
public cost. In the cities the increased attention to
the physical side of things is even more noticeable.
No expense is spared to make the new buildings
attractive and convenient. Libraries and laboratories,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
gymnasiums and toilet-rooms, are provided. In some
cities a free lunch is given to the pupils.</p>

<p>The school furniture is of the latest and most
approved pattern. The old idea of the adjustable
child who could be fitted to any kind of a seat or desk,
has given way to the new idea of the adjustable seat
and desk which can be fitted to any kind of a child.
School doctors are employed to make a physical examination
of the children. In a few cities there are
school nurses to attend to the pupils who are slightly
ailing.</p>

<p>Physical culture, in the form of calisthenics, military
drill, gymnastics, is introduced. Athletic organizations,
foot-ball clubs, base-ball clubs, are encouraged
among the boys. In every way the effort is
apparent to make school life attractive, more comfortable,
more healthful.</p>

<p>Some critics say that the effort is excessive, that it
spoils and softens the children, that it has distracted
their attention from the serious business of hard study.
I do not know. It is difficult for a man to remember
just how serious he was when he was a boy. Perhaps
the modern common-school pupil is less Spartan
and resolute than his father used to be. Perhaps
not. Pictures on the wall and flowers in the window,
gymnastics and music, may not really distract the
attention more than uncomfortable seats and bad
ventilation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>Another marked tendency in the American common
school, at least in the large towns and cities,
is the warm, one might almost say feverish, interest
in new courses and methods of study. In the primary
schools this shows itself chiefly in the introduction
of new ways of learning to spell and to cipher.
The alphabet and the multiplication table are no
longer regarded as necessities. The phonetic pupil
is almost in danger of supposing that reading, writing,
and arithmetic are literally &ldquo;the three <i>r</i>&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Hours
are given to nature-study, object-lessons, hygiene.
Children of tender years are instructed in the mysteries
of the digestive system. The range of mental
effort is immensely diversified.</p>

<p>In the high schools the increase of educational
novelties is even more apparent. The courses are
multiplied and divided. Elective studies are offered
in large quantity. I take an example from the programme
of a Western high school. The studies
required of all pupils are: English, history, algebra,
plane geometry, biology, physics, and Shakespeare.
The studies offered for a choice are: psychology, ethics,
commercial law, civics, economics, arithmetic, book-keeping,
higher algebra, solid geometry, trigonometry,
penmanship, phonography, drawing and the history
of art, chemistry, Latin, German, French, Spanish,
and Greek. This is quite a rich intellectual bill of
fare for boys and girls between fourteen and eighteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
years old. It seems almost encyclop&aelig;dic,&mdash;though
I miss a few subjects like Sanskrit, Egyptology,
photography, and comparative religions.</p>

<p>The fact is that in the American high schools,
as in the French <i>lyc&eacute;es</i> the effort to enlarge and
vary the curriculum by introducing studies which are
said to be &ldquo;urgently required by modern conditions&rdquo;
has led to considerable confusion of educational
ideals. But with us, while the extremes are worse,
owing to the lack of the central control, the disorder
is less universal, because the conservative schools
have been free to adhere to a simpler programme. It
is a good thing, no doubt, that the rigidity of the old
system, which made every pupil go through the same
course of classics and mathematics, has been relaxed.
But our danger now lies in the direction of using our
schools to fit boys and girls to make a living, rather
than to train them in a sound and vigorous intellectual
life. For this latter purpose it is not true that all
branches of study are of equal value. Some are
immensely superior. We want not the widest range,
but the best selection.</p>

<p>There are some points in which the public schools
of America, so far as one can judge from the general
reports, are inferior to those of France. One of
these points, naturally, is in the smooth working that
comes from uniformity and co&ouml;rdination. Another
point, strangely enough, is in the careful provision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
for moral instruction in the primary schools. At least
in the programmes of the French schools, much more
time and attention are given to this than in the
American programmes.</p>

<p>Another point of inferiority in the United States is
in the requirement of proper preparation and certification
of all teachers; and still another is in the
security of their tenure of office and the length of
their service in the profession. The teaching force
of the American schools is a noble army; but it
would be more efficient if the regular element were
larger in proportion to the volunteers. The <i>personnel</i>
changes too often.</p>

<p>One reason for this, no doubt, is the fact that the
women outnumber the men by three to one. Not
that the women are poorer teachers. Often, especially
in primary work, they are the best. But their
average term of professional service is not over four
years. They are interrupted by that great accident,
matrimony, which invites a woman to stop teaching,
and a man to continue.</p>

<p>The shortage of male teachers, which exists in so
many countries, is felt in extreme form in the United
States. Efforts are made to remedy it by the increase
of normal schools and teachers&rsquo; colleges, and by a
closer connection between the universities and the
public-school system.</p>

<p>In the conduct and development of the common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
schools we see the same voluntary, experimental,
pragmatic way of doing things that is so characteristic
of the Spirit of America in every department of life.
&ldquo;Education,&rdquo; say the Americans, &ldquo;is desirable,
profitable, and necessary. The best way for us to get
it is to work it out for ourselves. It must be practically
adapted to the local conditions of each community,
and to the personal needs of the individual. The
being of the child must be the centre of development.
What we want to do is to make good citizens for
American purposes. Liberty must be the foundation,
unity the superstructure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, upon the whole, is what the common schools
are doing for the United States: Three-fourths of the
children of the country (boys and girls studying together
from their sixth to their eighteenth year) are
in them. They are immensely democratic. They
are stronger in awakening the mind than in training
it. They do more to stimulate quick perception
than to cultivate sound judgment and correct taste.
Their principles are always good, their manners sometimes.
Universal knowledge is their foible; activity
is their temperament; energy and sincerity are their
virtues; superficiality is their defect.</p>

<p>Candour compels me to add one more touch to
this thumb-nail sketch of the American common
school. The children of the rich, the socially prominent,
the higher classes, if you choose to call them so,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
are not generally found in the public schools. At
least in the East and the South, most of these children
are educated in private schools and academies.</p>

<p>One cause of this is mere fashion. But there are
two other causes which may possibly deserve to be
called reasons, good or bad.</p>

<p>The first is the fear that coeducation, instead of
making the boys refined and the girls hardy, as it is
claimed, may effeminate the boys and roughen the girls.</p>

<p>The second is the wish to secure more thorough
and personal teaching in smaller classes. This the
private schools offer, usually at a high price. In the
older universities and colleges, a considerable part,
if not the larger number, of the student body, comes
from private preparatory schools and academies.
Yet it must be noted that of the men who take high
honours in scholarship a steadily increasing number,
already a majority, are graduates of the free public
high schools.</p>

<p>This proves what? That the State can give the
best if it wants to. That it is much more likely to
want to do so if it is enlightened, stimulated, and
guided by the voluntary effort of the more intelligent
part of the community.</p>

<p>III. This brings me to the last division of the
large subject around which I have been hastily circling:
the institutions of higher education,&mdash;universities,
colleges, and technological schools. Remem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>ber
that in America these different names are used
with bewildering freedom. They are not definitions,
nor even descriptions; they are simply &ldquo;tags.&rdquo; A
school of arts and trades, a school of modern languages,
may call itself a university. An institution
of liberal studies, with professional departments and
graduate schools attached to it, may call itself a
college. The size and splendour of the label does not
determine the value of the wine in the bottle. The
significance of an academic degree in America depends
not on the name, but on the quality, of the institution
that confers it.</p>

<p>But, generally speaking, you may understand that a
college is an institution which gives a four years&rsquo; course
in liberal arts and sciences, for which four years of
academic preparation are required: a university adds
to this, graduate courses, and one or more professional
schools of law, medicine, engineering, divinity, or
pedagogy; a technological school is one in which
the higher branches of the applied arts and sciences
are the chief subjects of study and in which only
scientific degrees are conferred.</p>

<p>Of these three kinds of institutions, 622 reported
to the United States Bureau of Education in 1906:
158 were for men only; 129 were for women only;
335 were coeducational. The number of professors
and instructors was 24,000. The number of undergraduate
and resident graduate students was 136,000.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
The income of these institutions for the year was
$40,000,000, of which a little less than half came
from tuition fees, and a little more than half
from gifts and endowments. The value of the real
estate and equipment was about $280,000,000, and
the invested funds for endowment amounted to
$236,000,000.</p>

<p>These are large figures. But they do not convey
any very definite idea to the mind, until we begin to
investigate them and ask what they mean. How
did this enormous enterprise of higher education
come into being? Who supports it? What is it
doing?</p>

<p>There are three ways in which the colleges and
universities of America have originated. They
have been founded by the churches to &ldquo;provide a
learned and godly ministry, and to promote knowledge
and sound intelligence in the community.&rdquo;
They have been endowed by private and personal
gifts and benefactions. They have been established
by States, and in a few cases by cities, to complete
and crown the common-school system.</p>

<p>But note that in the course of time important
changes have occurred. Most of the older and
larger universities which were at first practically supported
and controlled by churches, have now become
independent and are maintained by non-sectarian
support. The institutions which remain under con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>trol
of churches are the smaller colleges, the majority
of which were established between 1810 and 1870.</p>

<p>The universities established by a large gift or
bequest from a single person, of which Johns Hopkins
in Maryland, Leland Stanford in California, and
Chicago University founded by the head of the
Standard Oil Company, may be taken as examples,
are of comparatively recent origin. Their immediate
command of large wealth has enabled them
to do immense things quickly. Chicago is called by
a recent writer &ldquo;a University by enchantment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the foundation of State universities the South
pointed the way with the Universities of Tennessee
North Carolina, and Georgia, at the end of the eighteenth
century. But since that time the West has
distinctly taken the lead. Out of the twenty-nine
colleges and universities which report an enrolment
of over a thousand undergraduate and graduate
students, sixteen are State institutions, and fourteen
of these are west of the Alleghanies.</p>

<p>It is in these State universities, especially in the
Middle West, in Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois,
Minnesota, Iowa, that you will see the most remarkable
illustration of that thirst for knowledge, that
ambition for personal development, which is characteristic
of the Spirit of Young America.</p>

<p>The thousands of sons and daughters of farmers,
mechanics, and tradesmen, who flock to these institu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>tions,
are full of eagerness and hope. They are no
respecters of persons, but they have a tremendous
faith in the power of education. They all expect to
succeed in getting it, and to succeed in life by means
of it. They are alert, inquisitive, energetic; in their
work strenuous, and in their play enthusiastic.
They diffuse around them an atmosphere of joyous endeavour,&mdash;a
nervous, electric, rude, and bracing air.
They seem irreverent; but for the most part they are
only intensely earnest and direct. They pursue their
private aim with intensity. They &ldquo;want to know.&rdquo;
They may not be quite sure what it is that they want
to know. But they have no doubt that knowledge
is an excellent thing, and they have come to the university
to get it. This strong desire to learn, this
attitude of concentrated attack upon the secrets of
the universe, seems to me less noticeable among the
students of the older colleges of the East than it is in
these new big institutions of the Centre.</p>

<p>The State universities which have developed it,
or grown up to meet it, are in many cases wonderfully
well organized and equipped. Professors of
high standing have been brought from the Eastern
colleges and from Europe. The main stress, perhaps,
is laid upon practical results, and the technique of
industry. Studies which are supposed to be directly
utilitarian take the precedence over those which are
regarded as merely disciplinary. But in the best of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
these institutions the idea of general culture is maintained.</p>

<p>The University of Michigan, which is the oldest and
the largest of these western State universities, still
keeps its primacy with 4280 students drawn from
48 States and Territories. But the Universities of
Wisconsin, and Minnesota, and Illinois, and California
are not unworthy rivals.</p>

<p>A member of the British Commission which came
to study education in the United States four years ago
gave his judgment that the University of Wisconsin
was the foremost in America. Why? &ldquo;Because,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;it is a wholesome product of a commonwealth
of three millions of people; sane, industrial,
and progressive. It knits together the professions
and labours; it makes the fine arts and the anvil
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is a characteristic modern opinion, coming,
mark you, not from an American, but from an Englishman.
It reminds me of the advice which an old
judge gave to a young friend who had just been
raised to the judicial bench. &ldquo;Never give reasons,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;for your decisions. The decision may often
be right, but the reasons will probably be wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A thoughtful critic would say that the union of &ldquo;the
fine arts and the anvil&rdquo; was not a sufficient ground
for awarding the primacy to a university. Its standing
must be measured in its own sphere,&mdash;the realm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of knowledge and wisdom. It exists for the disinterested
pursuit of truth, for the development of the
intellectual life, and for the rounded development of
character. Its primary aim is not to fit men for any
specific industry, but to give them those things which
are everywhere essential to intelligent living. Its attention
must be fixed not on the work, but on the man.
In him, as a person, it must seek to develop four
powers&mdash;the power to see clearly, the power to
imagine vividly, the power to think independently,
and the power to will wisely and nobly. This is the
university ideal which a conservative critic would
maintain against the utilitarian theory. He might
admire the University of Wisconsin greatly, but it
would be for other reasons than those which the
Englishman gave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; this conservative would say, &ldquo;the
older American universities are still the most important
factors in the higher education of the country.
They have the traditions. They set the standard.
You cannot understand education in England without
going to Oxford and Cambridge, nor in America
without going to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and
Columbia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps the conservative would be right. At all
events, I wish that I could help the friendly foreign
observer to understand just what these older institutions
of learning, and some others like them, have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
meant and still mean to Americans. They are the
monuments of the devotion of our fathers to ideal
aims. They are the landmarks of the intellectual
life of the young republic. Time has changed them,
but it has not removed them. They still define
a region within which the making of a reasonable
man is the main interest, and truth is sought and
served for her own sake.</p>

<p>Originally, these older universities were almost
identical in form. They were called colleges and
based upon the idea of a uniform four years&rsquo; course
consisting mainly of Latin, Greek, and mathematics,
with an addition of history, philosophy, and natural
science in the last two years, and leading to the
degree of Bachelor of Arts. This was supposed to be
the way to make a reasonable man.</p>

<p>But in the course of time the desire to seek truth
in other regions, by other paths, led to a gradual
enlargement and finally to an immense expansion of
the curriculum. The department of letters was
opened to receive English and other modern languages.
The department of philosophy branched out
into economics and civics and experimental psychology.
History took notice of the fact that much has
happened since the fall of the Roman Empire.
Science threw wide its doors to receive the new
methods and discoveries of the nineteenth century.
The elective system of study came in like a flood from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Germany. The old-fashioned curriculum was submerged
and dissolved. The four senior colleges
came out as universities and began to differentiate
themselves.</p>

<p>Harvard, under the bold leadership of President
Eliot, went first and farthest in the development of
the elective system. One of its own graduates, Mr.
John Corbin, has recently written of it as &ldquo;a Germanized
university.&rdquo; It offers to its students free
choice among a multitude of courses so great that
it is said that one man could hardly take them all
in two hundred years. There is only one course
which every undergraduate is required to take,&mdash;English
composition in the Freshman year: 551
distinct courses are presented by the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences. In the whole university there are
556 officers of instruction and 4000 students. There
is no other institution in America which provides
such a rich, varied, and free chance for the individual
to develop his intellectual life.</p>

<p>Princeton, so far as the elective system is concerned,
represents the other extreme. President McCosh introduced
it with Scotch caution and reserve, in 1875.
It hardly went beyond the liberalizing of the last
two years of study. Other enlargements followed.
But at heart Princeton remained conservative.
It liked regularity, uniformity, system, more than it
liked freedom and variety. In recent years it has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
rearranged the electives in groups, which compel a
certain amount of unity in the main direction of a
student&rsquo;s effort. It has introduced a system of preceptors
or tutors who take personal charge of each
student in his reading and extra class-room work.
The picked men of the classes, who have won prizes,
or scholarships, or fellowships, go on with higher university
work in the graduate school. The divinity
school is academically independent, though closely
allied. There are no other professional schools.
Thus Princeton is distinctly &ldquo;a collegiate university,&rdquo;
with a very definite idea of what a liberal education
ought to include, and a fixed purpose of developing
the individual by leading him through a regulated intellectual
discipline.</p>

<p>Yale, the second in age of the American universities,
occupies a middle ground, and fills it with immense
vigour. Very slow in yielding to the elective system,
Yale theoretically adopted it four years ago in its
extreme form. But in practice the &ldquo;Yale Spirit&rdquo;
preserves the unity of each class from entrance to
graduation; the &ldquo;average man&rdquo; is much more of a
controlling factor than he is at Harvard, and the solid
body of students in the Department of Arts and
Sciences gives tone to the whole university. Yale
is typically American in its love of liberty and its
faculty of self-organization. It draws its support
from a wider range of country than either Harvard or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Princeton. It has not been a leader in the production
of advanced ideas or educational methods. Originality
is not its mark. Efficiency is. No other
American university has done more in giving men
of light and leading to industrial, professional, and
public life in the United States.</p>

<p>Columbia, by its location in the largest of the American
cities, and by the direction which its last three
presidents have given to its policy, has become much
stronger in its professional schools and its advanced
graduate work, than in its undergraduate college.
Its schools of mines and law and medicine are famous.
In its graduate courses it has as many students
enrolled as Harvard, Yale, and Michigan put together.
It has a library of 450,000 volumes, and
endowment for various kinds of special study, including
Chinese and journalism.</p>

<p>None of these four universities is coeducational in
the department of arts and sciences. But Harvard
and Columbia each have an annex for women,&mdash;Radcliffe
College and Barnard College,&mdash;in which
the university professors lecture and teach.</p>

<p>In Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and most of the older
colleges, except those which are situated in the great
cities, there is a common life of the students which
is peculiar, I believe, to America, and highly characteristic
and interesting. They reside together in large
halls or dormitories grouped in an academic estate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
which is almost always beautiful with ancient trees
and spacious lawns. There is nothing like the caste
division among them which is permitted, if not
fostered, at Oxford and Cambridge by the existence
of distinct colleges in the same university. They belong
to the same social body, a community of youth
bound together for a happy interval of four years
between the strict discipline of school and the separating
pressure of life in the outer world. They
have their own customs and traditions, often absurd,
always picturesque and amusing. They have their
own interests, chief among which is the cultivation
of warm friendships among men of the same age.
They organize their own clubs and societies, athletic,
musical, literary, dramatic, or purely social, according
to elective affinity. But the class spirit creates
a ground of unity for all who enter and graduate
together, and the college spirit makes a common tie
for all.</p>

<p>It is a little world by itself,&mdash;this American
college life,&mdash;incredibly free, yet on the whole
self-controlled and morally sound,&mdash;physically active
and joyful, yet at bottom full of serious purpose.
See the students on the athletic field at some great
foot-ball or base-ball match; hear their volleying
cheers, their ringing songs of encouragement or
victory; watch their waving colours, their eager
faces, their movements of excitement as the fortune<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
of the game shifts and changes; and you might
think that these young men cared for nothing
but out-of-door sport. But that noisy enthusiasm
is the natural overflow of youthful spirits. The
athletic game gives it the easiest outlet, the simplest
opportunity to express college loyalty by an outward
sign, a shout, a cheer, a song. Follow the same men
from day to day, from week to week, and you
will find that the majority of them, even among the
athletes, know that the central object of their college
life is to get an education. But they will tell you,
also, that this education does not come only from the
lecture-room, the class, the library. An indispensable
and vital part of it comes from their daily contact with
one another in play and work and comradeship,&mdash;from
the chance which college gives them to know,
and estimate, and choose, their friends among their
fellows.</p>

<p>It is intensely democratic,&mdash;this American college
life,&mdash;and therefore it has distinctions, as every real
democracy must. But they are not artificial and conventional.
They are based in the main upon what a
man is and does, what contribution he makes to the
honour and joy and fellowship of the community.</p>

<p>The entrance of the son of a millionnaire, of a high
official, of a famous man, is noted, of course. But it is
noted only as a curious fact of natural history which
has no bearing upon the college world. The real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
question is, What kind of a fellow is the new man?
Is he a good companion; has he the power of leadership;
can he do anything particularly well; is he a
vigorous and friendly person? Wealth and parental
fame do not count, except perhaps as slight hindrances,
because of the subconscious jealousy which
they arouse in a community where the majority do not
possess them. Poverty does not count at all, unless
it makes the man himself proud and shy, or confines
him so closely to the work of self-support that he has
no time to mix with the crowd. Men who are working
their own way through college are often the
leaders in popularity and influence.</p>

<p>I do not say that there are no social distinctions in
American college life. There, as in the great world,
little groups of men are drawn together by expensive
tastes and amusements; little coteries are formed
which aim at exclusiveness. But these are of no real
account in the student body. It lives in a brisk and
wholesome air of free competition in study and sport,
of free intercourse on a human basis.</p>

<p>It is this tone of humanity, of sincerity, of joyful
contact with reality, in student life, that makes the
American graduate love his college with a sentiment
which must seem to foreigners almost like sentimentality.
His memory holds her as the <i>Alma Mater</i> of
his happiest years. He goes back to visit her halls,
her playgrounds, her shady walks, year after year, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
one returns to a shrine of the heart. He sings the
college songs, he joins in the college cheers, with an
enthusiasm which does not die as his voice loses the
ring of youth. And when gray hairs come upon him,
he still walks with his class among the old graduates
at the head of the commencement procession. It is
all a little strange, a little absurd, perhaps, to one who
watches it critically, from the outside. But to the
man himself it is simply a natural tribute to the good
and wholesome memory of American college life.</p>

<p>But what are its results from the educational point
of view? What do these colleges and universities do
for the intellectual life of the country? Doubtless
they are still far from perfect in method and achievement.
Doubtless they let many students pass
through them without acquiring mental thoroughness,
philosophical balance, fine culture. Doubtless they
need to advance in the standard of teaching, the
strictness of examination, the encouragement of research.
They have much to learn. They are
learning.</p>

<p>Great central institutions like those which Mr.
Carnegie has endowed for the Promotion of Research
and for the Advancement of Teaching will help
progress. Conservative experiments and liberal experiments
will lead to better knowledge.</p>

<p>But whatever changes are made, whatever improvements
arrive in the higher education in America,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
one thing I hope will never be given up,&mdash;the free,
democratic, united student life of our colleges and
universities. For without this factor we cannot
develop the kind of intellectual person who will be at
home in the republic. The world in which he has to
live will not ask him what degrees he has taken.
It will ask him simply what he is, and what he can do.
If he is to be a leader in a country where the people are
sovereign, he must add to the power to see clearly,
to imagine vividly, to think independently, and to will
wisely, the faculty of knowing other men as they are,
and of working with them for what they ought to be.
And one of the best places to get this faculty is in the
student life of an American college.</p>

<h2>VII<br />

SELF-EXPRESSION AND LITERATURE</h2>


<p>All human activity is, in a certain sense, a mode
of self-expression. The works of man in the organization
of the State, in the development of industry,
in voluntary effort for the improvement of the common
order, are an utterance of his inner life.</p>

<p>But it is natural for him to seek a fuller, clearer,
more conscious mode of self-expression, to speak
more directly of his ideals, thoughts, and feelings.
It is this direct utterance of the Spirit of America,
as it is found in literature, which I propose now,
and in the following lectures,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to discuss.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Around the political and ecclesiastical and social
structures which men build for themselves there are
always flowing great tides and currents of human
speech; like the discussions in the studio of the architect,
the confused murmur of talk among the workmen,
the curious and wondering comments of the
passing crowd, when some vast cathedral or palace
or hall of industry is rising from the silent earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Man is a talking animal. The daily debates of the
forum and the market-place, the orations and lectures
of a thousand platforms, the sermons and exhortations
of the thousand pulpits, the ceaseless
conversation of the street and the fireside, all confess
that one of the deepest of human appetites and passions
is for self-expression and intercourse, to reveal
and to communicate the hidden motions of the spirit
that is in man.</p>

<p>Language, said a cynic, is chiefly useful to conceal
thought. But that is only a late-discovered, minor,
and decadent use of speech. If concealment had
been the first and chief need that man felt, he never
would have made a language. He would have remained
silent. He would have lived among the
trees, contented with that inarticulate chatter which
still keeps the thoughts of monkeys (if they have
any) so well concealed.</p>

<p>But vastly the greater part of human effort toward
self-expression serves only the need of the transient
individual, the passing hour. It sounds incessantly
beneath the silent stars,&mdash;this murmur, this roar,
this <i>susurrus</i> of mingled voices,&mdash;and melts continually
into the vague inane. The idle talk of the
multitude, the eloquence of golden tongues, the shouts
of brazen throats, go by and are forgotten, like the
wind that passes through the rustling leaves of the
forest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>In the fine arts man has invented not only a more
perfect and sensitive, but also a more enduring, form
for the expression of that which fills his spirit with
the joy and wonder of living. His sense of beauty
and order; the response of something within him
to certain aspects of nature, certain events of life;
his interpretation of the vague and mysterious things
about him which seem to suggest a secret meaning;
his delight in the intensity and clearness of single
impressions, in the symmetry and proportion of
related objects; his double desire to surpass nature,
on the one side by the simplicity and unity of his
work, or on the other side by the freedom of its range
and the richness of its imagery; his sudden glimpses
of truth; his persistent visions of virtue; his perception
of human misery and his hopes of human excellence;
his deep thoughts and solemn dreams of the
Divine,&mdash;all these he strives to embody, clearly or
vaguely, by symbol, or allusion, or imitation, in
painting and sculpture, music and architecture.</p>

<p>The medium of these arts is physical; they speak
to the eye and the ear. But their ultimate appeal is
spiritual, and the pleasure which they give goes far
deeper than the outward senses.</p>

<p>In literature we have another art whose very medium
is more than half spiritual. For words are
not like lines, or colours, or sounds. They are living
creatures begotten in the soul of man. They come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
to us saturated with human meaning and association.
They are vitally related to the emotions and thoughts
out of which they have sprung. They have a wider
range, a more delicate precision, a more direct and penetrating
power than any other medium of expression.</p>

<p>The art of literature which weaves these living
threads into its fabric lies closer to the common
life and rises higher into the ideal life than any other
art. In the lyric, the drama, the epic, the romance,
the fable, the <i>conte</i>, the essay, the history, the biography,
it not only speaks to the present hour, but also
leaves its record for the future.</p>

<p>Literature consists of those writings which interpret
the meanings of nature and life, in words of
charm and power, touched with the personality of
the author, in artistic forms of permanent interest.</p>

<p>Out of the common utterances of men, the daily
flood of language spoken and written, by which they
express their thoughts and feelings,&mdash;out of that
current of journalism and oratory, preaching and
debate, literature comes. But with that current it
does not pass away. Art has endowed it with the
magic which confers a distinct life, a longer endurance,
a so-called immortality. It is the ark on the
flood. It is the light on the candlestick. It is the
flower among the leaves, the consummation of the
plant&rsquo;s vitality, the crown of its beauty, the treasure-house
of its seeds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>Races and nations have existed without a literature.
But their life has been dumb. With their
death their power has departed.</p>

<p>What does the world know of the thoughts and
feelings of those unlettered tribes of white and black
and yellow and red, flitting in ghost-like pantomime
across the background of the stage? Whatever
message they may have had for us, of warning, of
encouragement, of hope, of guidance, remains undelivered.
They are but phantoms, mysterious and
ineffective.</p>

<p>But with literature life arrives at utterance and
lasting power. The Scythians, the Etruscans, the
Ph&#339;nicians, the Carthaginians, have vanished into
thin air. We grope among their ruined cities. We
collect their figured pottery, their rusted coins and
weapons. And we wonder what manner of men
they were. But the Greeks, the Hebrews, the Romans,
still live. We know their thoughts and feelings,
their loves and hates, their motives and ideals.
They touch us and move us to-day through a vital
literature. Nor should we fully understand their
other arts, nor grasp the meaning of their political
and social institutions without the light which is
kindled within them by the ever-burning torch of
letters.</p>

<p>The Americans do not belong among the dumb
races. Their spiritual descent is not from Etruria<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
and Ph&#339;nicia and Carthage, nor from the silent red
man of the western forests. Intellectually, like all
the leading races of Europe, they inherit from Greece
and Rome and Palestine.</p>

<p>Their instinct of self-expression in the arts has been
slower to assert itself than those other traits which
we have been considering,&mdash;self-reliance, fair-play,
common order, the desire of personal development.
But they have taken part, and they still
take part (not altogether inaudibly), in the general
conversation and current debate of the world. Moreover,
they have begun to create a native literature
which utters, to some extent at least, the thoughts
and feelings of the soul of the people.</p>

<p>This literature, considered in its <i>ensemble</i> as an
expression of our country, raises some interesting
questions which I should like to answer. Why
has it been so slow to begin? Why is it not more
recognizably American? What are the qualities
in which it really expresses the Spirit of America?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I. If you ask me why a native literature has been
so slow to begin in America, I answer, first, <i>that it has
not been slow at all</i>. Compared with other races,
the Americans have been rather less slow than the
average in seeking self-expression in literary form
and in producing books which have survived the
generation which produced them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>How long was it, for example, before the Hebrews
began to create a literature? A definite answer to
that question would bring us into trouble with the
theologians. But at least we may say that from
the beginning of the Hebrew Commonwealth to the
time of the prophet Samuel there were three centuries
and a half without literature.</p>

<p>How long did Rome exist before its literary activities
began? Of course we do not know what books
may have perished. But the first Romans whose
names have kept a place in literature were N&aelig;vius
and Ennius, who began to write more than five
hundred years after the city was founded.</p>

<p>Compared with these long periods of silence, the
two hundred years between the settlement of America
and the appearance of Washington Irving and James
Fenimore Cooper seems but a short time.</p>

<p>Even earlier than these writers I should be inclined
to claim a place in literature for two Americans,&mdash;Jonathan
Edwards and Benjamin Franklin.
Indeed it is possible that the clean-cut philosophical
essays of the iron-clad Edwards, and the intensely
human autobiography of the shrewd and genial
Franklin may continue to find critical admirers and
real readers long after many writers, at present more
praised, have been forgotten.</p>

<p>But if you will allow me this preliminary protest
against the superficial notion that the Americans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
have been remarkably backward in producing a
national literature, I will make a concession to current
and commonplace criticism by admitting that
they were not as quick in turning to literary self-expression
as might have been expected. They were
not a mentally sluggish people. They were a race
of idealists. They were fairly well educated. Why
did they not go to work at once, with their intense
energy, to produce a national literature on demand?</p>

<p>One reason, perhaps, was that they had the good
sense to perceive that a national literature never has
been, and never can be, produced in this way. It is
not made to order. It grows.</p>

<p>Another reason, no doubt, was the fact that they
already had more books than they had time to read.
They were the inheritors of the literature of Europe.
They had the classics and the old masters. Milton
and Dryden and Locke wrote for them. Pope and
Johnson, Defoe and Goldsmith, wrote for them.
Cervantes and Le Sage wrote for them. Montesquieu
and Rousseau wrote for them. Richardson
and Smollett and Fielding gave them a plenty of
long-measure novels. Above all, they found an overflowing
supply of books of edification in the religious
writings of Thomas Fuller, Richard Baxter, John
Bunyan, Philip Doddridge, Matthew Henry, and
other copious Puritans. There was no pressing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
need of mental food for the Americans. The supply
was equal to the demand.</p>

<p>Another reason, possibly, was the fact that they
did not have a new language, with all its words fresh
and vivid from their origin in life, to develop and
exploit. This was at once an advantage and a disadvantage.</p>

<p>English was not the mother-tongue of all the colonists.
For two or three generations there was a confusion
of speech in the middle settlements. It is
recorded of a certain young Dutchwoman from New
Amsterdam, travelling to the English province of
Connecticut, that she was in danger of being tried for
witchcraft because she spoke a diabolical tongue,
evidently marking her as &ldquo;a child of Satan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this polyglot period passed away, and the
people in general spoke</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;the tongue that Shakespeare spoke,&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">spoke it indeed rather more literally than the English
did, retaining old locutions like &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; and
sprinkling their talk with &ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;ams,&rdquo;&mdash;which
have since come to be considered as Americanisms,
whereas they are really Elizabethanisms.</p>

<p>The possession of a language that is already consolidated,
organized, enriched with a vast vocabulary,
and dignified by literary use, has two effects.
It makes the joyful and unconscious literature of
adolescence, the period of popular ballads and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
rhymed chronicles, quaint animal-epics and miracle-plays,
impossible. It offers to the literature of maturity
an instrument of expression equal to its needs.</p>

<p>But such a language carries with it discouragements
as well as invitations. It sets a high standard
of excellence. It demands courage and strength to
use it in any but an imitative way.</p>

<p>Do not misunderstand me here. The Americans,
since that blending of experience which made them
one people, have never felt that the English language
was strange or foreign to them. They did not adopt
or borrow it. It was their own native tongue. They
grew up in it. They contributed to it. It belonged
to them. But perhaps they hesitated a little to use
it freely and fearlessly and originally while they
were still in a position of tutelage and dependence.
Perhaps they waited for the consciousness that they
were indeed grown up,&mdash;a consciousness which
did not fully come until after the War of 1812.
Perhaps they needed to feel the richness of their own
experience, the vigour of their own inward life, before
they could enter upon the literary use of that most
rich and vigorous of modern languages.</p>

<p>Another reason why American literature did not
develop sooner was the absorption of the energy
of the people in other tasks than writing. They
had to chop down trees, to build houses, to plough
prairies. It is one thing to explore the wilderness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
as Chateaubriand did, an elegant visitor looking
for the materials of romance. It is another thing to
live in the wilderness and fight with it for a living.
Real pioneers are sometimes poets at heart. But
they seldom write their poetry.</p>

<p>After the Americans had won their security and
their daily bread in the wild country, they had still
to make a State, to develop a social order, to provide
themselves with schools and churches, to do all
kinds of things which demand time, and toil, and the
sweat of the brow. It was a busy world. There
was more work to be done than there were workmen
to do it. Industry claimed every talent almost as
soon as it got into breeches.</p>

<p>A Franklin, who might have written essays or
philosophical treatises in the manner of Diderot,
must run a printing-press, invent stoves, pave streets,
conduct a postal service, raise money for the War of
Independence. A Freneau, who might have written
lyrics in the manner of Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier, must become
a soldier, a sea-captain, an editor, a farmer.</p>

<p>Even those talents which were drawn to the intellectual
side of life were absorbed in the efforts which
belong to the current discussions of affairs, the daily
debate of the world, rather than to literature. They
disputed, they argued, they exhorted, with a direct
aim at practical results in morals and conduct.
They became preachers, orators, politicians, pam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>phleteers.
They wrote a good deal; but their writing
has the effect of reported speech addressed to an
audience. The mass of sermons, and political
papers, and long letters on timely topics, which
America produced in her first two hundred years
is considerable. It contains much more vitality
than the imitative essays, poems, and romances of
the same period.</p>

<p>John Dickinson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Letters from a Pennsylvania
Farmer,&rdquo; the sermons of President Witherspoon of
Princeton, the papers of Madison, Hamilton, and
Jay in the <i>Federalist</i>, are not bad reading, even
to-day. They are virile and significant. They
show that the Americans knew how to use the English
language in its eighteenth-century form. But
they were produced to serve a practical purpose.
Therefore they lack the final touch of that art whose
primary aim is the pleasure of self-expression in
forms as permanent and as perfect as may be found.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>II. The second question which I shall try to
answer is this: Why is not the literature of America,
not only in the beginning but also in its later development,
more distinctly American?</p>

<p>The answer is simple: <i>It is distinctly American</i>.
But unfortunately the critics who are calling so persistently
and looking so eagerly for &ldquo;Americanism&rdquo;
in literature, do not recognize it when they see it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>They are looking for something strange, eccentric,
radical, and rude. When a real American like
Franklin, or Irving, or Emerson, or Longfellow, or
Lanier, or Howells appears, these critics will not
believe that he is the genuine article. They expect
something in the style of &ldquo;Buffalo Bill.&rdquo; They
imagine the Spirit of America always in a red shirt,
striped trousers, and rawhide boots.</p>

<p>They recognize the Americanism of Washington
when he crosses the forest to Fort Duquesne in his
leather blouse and leggings. But when he appears
at Mount Vernon in black velvet and lace ruffles,
they say, &ldquo;This is no American after all, but a transplanted
English squire.&rdquo; They acknowledge that
Francis Parkman is an American when he follows
the Oregon trail on horseback in hunter&rsquo;s dress.
But when he sits in the tranquil library of his West
Roxbury home surrounded by its rose gardens, they
say, &ldquo;This is no American, but a gentleman of Europe
in exile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How often must our critics be reminded that the
makers of America were not redskins nor amiable
ruffians, but rather decent folk, with perhaps an extravagant
admiration for order and respectability?
When will they learn that the descendants of these
people, when they come to write books, cannot be
expected to show the qualities of barbarians and
iconoclasts? How shall we persuade them to look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
at American literature not for the by-product of
eccentricity, but for the self-expression of a sane and
civilized people? I doubt whether it will ever be
possible to effect this conversion and enlightenment;
for nothing is so strictly closed against criticism as
the average critic&rsquo;s adherence to the point of view
imposed by his own limitations. But it is a pity,
in this case, that the point of view is not within sight
of the facts.</p>

<p>There is a story that the English poet Tennyson
once said that he was glad that he had never met
Longfellow, because he would not have liked to see
the American poet put his feet upon the table. If
the story is true, it is most laughable. For nothing
could be more unlike the super-refined Longfellow
than to put his feet in the wrong place, either on the
table, or in his verse. Yet he was an American of
the Americans, the literary idol of his country.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the literature of America would
be more recognizable if those who consider it from
the outside knew more of the real spirit of the country.
If they were not always looking for volcanoes
and earthquakes, they might learn to identify the
actual features of the landscape.</p>

<p>But when I have said this, honesty compels me to
go a little further and admit that the full, complete
life of America still lacks an adequate expression in
literature. Perhaps it is too large and variegated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
in its outward forms, too simple in its individual
types, and too complex in their combination, ever to
find this perfect expression. Certainly we are still
waiting for &ldquo;the great American Novel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may be that we shall have to wait a long time
for this comprehensive and significant book which
will compress into a single cup of fiction all the different
qualities of the Spirit of America, all the fermenting
elements that mingle in the vintage of the
New World. But in this hope deferred,&mdash;if indeed
it be a hope that can be reasonably entertained at
all,&mdash;we are in no worse estate than the other complex
modern nations. What English novel gives a
perfect picture of all England in the nineteenth century?
Which of the French romances of the last
twenty years expresses the whole spirit of France?</p>

<p>Meantime it is not difficult to find certain partial
and local reflections of the inner and outer life of
the real America in the literature, limited in amount
though it be, which has already been produced in
that country. In some of it the local quality of
thought or language is so predominant as to act
almost as a barrier to exportation. But there is a
smaller quantity which may fairly be called &ldquo;good
anywhere&rdquo;; and to us it is, and ought to be, doubly
good because of its Americanism.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, any reader who understands
the tone and character of life in the Middle States,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
around New York and Philadelphia, in the first
quarter of the nineteenth century, feels that the ideas
and feelings of the more intelligent people, those who
were capable of using or of appreciating literary
forms, are well enough represented in the writings
of the so-called &ldquo;Knickerbocker School.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Washington Irving, the genial humorist, the delicate
and sympathetic essayist and story-teller of
<i>The Sketch-Book</i>, was the first veritable &ldquo;man of
letters&rdquo; in America. Cooper, the inexhaustible teller-of-tales
in the open air, the lover of brave adventure
in the forest and on the sea, the Homer of the backwoodsman,
and the idealist of the noble savage, was
the discoverer of real romance in the New World.</p>

<p>Including other writers of slighter and less spontaneous
talent, like Halleck, Drake, and Paulding,
this school was marked by a cheerful and optimistic
view of life, a tone of feeling more sentimental than
impassioned, a friendly interest in humanity rather
than an intense moral enthusiasm, and a flowing,
easy style,&mdash;the manner of a company of people
living in comfort and good order, people of social
habits, good digestion, and settled opinions, who
sought in literature more of entertainment and relaxation
than of inspiration or what the strenuous reformers
call &ldquo;uplift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the days when its fashionable idol was Willis,
and its honoured though slightly cold poet was Bry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>ant,
and its neglected and embittered genius was
Edgar Allan Poe, this school, lacking the elements of
inward coherence, passed into a period of decline.
It revived again in such writers as George William
Curtis, Donald Mitchell, Bayard Taylor, Charles
Dudley Warner, Frank R. Stockton; and it continues
some of its qualities in the present-day writers
whose centre is undoubtedly New York.</p>

<p>Is it imaginary, or can I really feel some traces, here
and there, of the same influences which affected the
&ldquo;Knickerbocker School&rdquo; in such different writers as
Mark Twain and William Dean Howells, in spite of
their western origin? Certainly it can be felt in
essayists like Hamilton Mabie and Edward S. Martin
and Brander Matthews, in novelists like Dr.
Weir Mitchell and Hopkinson Smith, in poets like
Aldrich and Stedman, and even in the later work of
a native lyrist like Richard Watson Gilder. There
is something,&mdash;I know not what,&mdash;a kind of <i>urbanum
genus dicendi</i>, which speaks of the great city
in the background and of a tradition continued.
Even in the work of such a cosmopolitan and relentless
novelist as Mrs. Wharton, or of such an independent
and searching critic as Mr. Brownell, my
mental palate catches a flavour of America and a
reminiscence of New York; though now indeed
there is little or nothing left of the Knickerbocker
optimism and cheerful sentimentality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>The American school of historians, including
such writers as Ticknor, Prescott, Bancroft, Motley,
and Parkman, represents the growing interest of the
people of the New World for the history of the Old,
as well as their desire to know more about their
own origin and development. Motley&rsquo;s <i>Rise of the
Dutch Republic</i>, Parkman&rsquo;s volumes on the French
settlements in Canada, Sloane&rsquo;s <i>Life of Napoleon</i>,
and Henry C. Lea&rsquo;s <i>History of the Inquisition</i>
are not only distinguished works of scholarship,
but also eminently readable and interesting expressions
of the mind of a great republic considering
important events and institutions in other countries
to which its own history was closely related.
The serious and laborious efforts of Bancroft to produce
a clear and complete <i>History of the United
States</i> resulted in a work of great dignity and value.
But much was left for others to do in the way of exploring
the sources of the nation, and in closer study
of its critical epochs. This task has been well
continued by such historians as John Fiske, Henry
Adams, James Bach McMaster, John Codman
Ropes, James Ford Rhodes, Justin Winsor, and
Sydney G. Fisher.</p>

<p>These are only some of the principal names which
may be cited to show that few countries have better
reason than the United States to be proud of a
school of historians whose works are not only well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
documented, but also well written, and so entitled
to be counted as literature.</p>

<p>The Southern States, before the Civil War and
for a little time after, were not largely represented
in American letters. In prose they had a fluent
romancer, Simms, who wrote somewhat in the manner
of Cooper, but with less skill and force; an
exquisite artist of the short-story and the lyric, Poe,
who, although he was born in Boston and did most of
his work in Philadelphia and New York, may perhaps
be counted sympathetically with the South;
two agreeable story-tellers, John Esten Cooke and
John P. Kennedy; two delicate and charming lyrists,
Paul Hayne and Henry Timrod; and one greatly
gifted poet, Sidney Lanier, whose career was cut
short by a premature death.</p>

<p>But the distinctive spirit of the South did not
really find an adequate utterance in early American
literature, and it is only of late years that it is beginning
to do so. The fine and memorable stories of
George W. Cable reflect the poesy and romance
of the creole life in Louisiana. James Lane Allen
and Thomas Nelson Page express in their prose the
Southern atmosphere and temperament. The poems
of Madison Cawein are full of the bloom and fragrance
of Kentucky. Among the women who write,
Alice Hegan Rice, &ldquo;Charles Egbert Craddock,&rdquo;
Ruth McEnery Stuart, &ldquo;George Madden Martin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>&rdquo;
and Mary Johnston may be named as charming
story-tellers of the South. Joel Chandler Harris
has made the old negro folk-tales classic, in his
<i>Uncle Remus</i>,&mdash;a work which belongs, if I mistake
not, to one of the most enduring types of literature.</p>

<p>But beyond a doubt the richest and finest flowering
of <i>belles lettres</i> in the United States during the
nineteenth century was that which has been called
&ldquo;the Renaissance of New England.&rdquo; The quickening
of moral and intellectual life which followed
the Unitarian movement in theology, the antislavery
agitation in society, and the transcendental fermentation
in philosophy may not have caused, but it
certainly influenced, the development of a group of
writers, just before the middle of the century, who
brought a deeper and fuller note into American
poetry and prose.</p>

<p>Hawthorne, profound and lonely genius, dramatist
of the inner life, master of the symbolic story,
endowed with the double gift of deep insight and
exquisite art; Emerson, herald of self-reliance and
poet of the intuitions, whose prose and verse flash
with gem-like thoughts and fancies, and whose
calm, vigorous accents were potent to awaken and
sustain the intellectual independence of America;
Longfellow, the sweetest and the richest voice of
American song, the household poet of the New
World; Whittier, the Quaker bard, whose ballads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
and lyrics reflect so perfectly the scenery and the sentiment
of New England; Holmes, genial and pungent
wit, native humorist, with a deep spring of sympathy
and a clear vein of poetry in his many-sided personality;
Lowell, generous poet of high and noble emotions,
inimitable writer of dialect verse, penetrating
critic and essayist,&mdash;these six authors form a group
not yet equalled in the literary history of America.</p>

<p>The factors of strength, and the hidden elements
of beauty, in the Puritan character came to flower
and fruit in these men. They were liberated,
enlarged, quickened by the strange flood of poetry,
philosophy, and romantic sentiment which flowed
into the somewhat narrow and sombre enceinte of
Yankee thought and life. They found around them
a circle of eager and admiring readers who had
felt the same influences. The circle grew wider and
wider as the charm and power of these writers made
itself felt, and as their ideas were diffused. Their
work, always keeping a distinct New England colour,
had in it a substance of thought and feeling, an
excellence of form and texture, which gave it a much
broader appeal. Their fame passed from the sectional
to the national stage. In their day Boston
was the literary centre of the United States. And
in after days, though the sceptre has passed, the
influence of these men may be traced in almost all
American writers, of the East, the West, or the South,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
in every field of literature, except perhaps the region
of realistic or romantic fiction.</p>

<p>Here it seems as if the West had taken the lead.
Bret Harte, with his frontier stories, always vivid
but not always accurate, was the founder of a new
school, or at least the discoverer of a new mine of
material, in which Frank Norris followed with some
powerful work, too soon cut short by death, and
where a number of living men like Owen Wister,
Stewart Edward White, and O. Henry are finding
graphic stories to tell. Hamlin Garland, Booth
Tarkington, William Allen White, and Robert
Herrick are vigorous romancers of the Middle West.
Winston Churchill studies politics and people in
various regions, while Robert Chambers explores
the social complications of New York; and both
write novels which are full of interest for Americans
and count their readers by the hundred thousand.</p>

<p>In the short-story Miss Jewett, Miss Wilkins, and
Mrs. Deland have developed characteristic and
charming forms of a difficult art. In poetry George
E. Woodberry and William Vaughn Moody have
continued the tradition of Emerson and Lowell in
lofty and pregnant verse. Joaquin Miller has sung
the songs of the Sierras, and Edwin Markham the
chant of labour. James Whitcomb Riley has put
the very heart of the Middle West into his familiar
poems, humorous and pathetic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>And Walt Whitman, the &ldquo;democratic bard,&rdquo; the
poet who broke all the poetic traditions? Is it too
soon to determine whether his revolution in literature
was a success, whether he was a great initiator
or only a great exception? Perhaps so. But it is
not too soon to recognize the beauty of feeling and
form, and the strong Americanism, of his poems on
the death of Lincoln, and the power of some of his
descriptive lines, whether they are verse or rhapsodic
prose.</p>

<p>It is evident that such a list of names as I have
been trying to give must necessarily be very imperfect.
Many names of substantial value are omitted.
The field is not completely covered. But at least
it may serve to indicate some of the different schools
and sources, and to give some idea of the large literary
activity in which various elements and aspects
of the Spirit of America have found and are finding
expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>III. The real value of literature is to be sought
in its power to express and to impress. What relation
does it bear to the interpretation of nature and life
in a certain country at a certain time? That is the
question in its historical form. How clearly, how
beautifully, how perfectly, does it give that interpretation
in concrete works of art? That is the question
in its purely &aelig;sthetic form. What personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
qualities, what traits of human temperament and
disposition does it reveal most characteristically
in the spirit of the land? That is the question in
the form which belongs to the study of human nature.</p>

<p>It is in this last form that I wish to put the question,
just now, in order to follow logically the line
marked by the general title of these lectures. The
Spirit of America is to be understood not only by
the five elements of character which I have tried to
sketch in outline,&mdash;the instinct of self-reliance, the
love of fair-play, the energetic will, the desire of order,
the ambition of self-development. It has also certain
temperamental traits; less easy to define, perhaps;
certainly less clearly shown in national and
social institutions, but not less important to an intimate
acquaintance with the people.</p>

<p>These temperamental traits are the very things
which are most distinctive in literature. They give
it colour and flavour. They are the things which
touch it with personality. In American literature,
if you look at it broadly, I think you will find four
of these traits most clearly revealed,&mdash;a strong religious
feeling, a sincere love of nature, a vivid sense
of humour, and a deep sentiment of humanity.</p>

<p>(1) It may seem strange to say that a country
which does not even name the Supreme Being in its
national constitution, which has no established form
of worship or belief, and whose public schools and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
universities are expressly disconnected from any
kind of church control, is at the same time strongly
religious, in its temperament. Yet strange as this
seems, it is true of America.</p>

<p>The entire independence of Church and State was
the result of a deliberate conviction, in which the
interest of religion was probably the chief consideration.
In the life of the people the Church has been
not less, but more, potent than in most other countries.
Professor Wendell was perfectly right in the lectures
which he delivered in Paris four years ago, when he
laid so much emphasis upon the influence of religion
in determining the course of thought and the character
of literature in America. Professor M&uuml;nsterberg
is thoroughly correct when he says in his
excellent book <i>The Americans</i>, &ldquo;The entire American
people are in fact profoundly religious, and
have been, from the day when the Pilgrim Fathers
landed, down to the present moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The proof of this is not to be seen merely in outward
observance, though I suppose there is hardly
any other country, except Scotland, in which there
is so much church-going, Sabbath-keeping, and
Bible-reading. It is estimated that less than fifteen
of the eighty millions of total population are entirely
out of touch with any church. But all this might
be rather superficial, formal, conventional. It
might be only a hypocritical cover for practical in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>fidelity.
And sometimes when one reads the &ldquo;yellow
journals&rdquo; with their flaming exposures of social
immorality, industrial dishonesty, and political corruption,
one is tempted to think that it may be so.</p>

<p>Yet a broader, deeper, saner view,&mdash;a steady
look into the real life of the typical American home,
the normal American community,&mdash;reveals the fact
that the black spots are on the surface and not in
the heart of the country.</p>

<p>The heart of the people at large is still old-fashioned
in its adherence to the idea that every man is
responsible to a higher moral and spiritual power,&mdash;that
duty is more than pleasure,&mdash;that life cannot
be translated in terms of the five senses, and that the
attempt to do so lowers and degrades the man who
makes it,&mdash;that religion alone can give an adequate
interpretation of life, and that morality alone can
make it worthy of respect and admiration. This
is the characteristic American way of looking at the
complicated and interesting business of living which
we men and women have upon our hands.</p>

<p>It is rather a sober and intense view. It is not
always free from prejudice, from bigotry, from
fanaticism, from superstition. It is open to invasion
by strange and uncouth forms of religiosity.
America has offered a fertile soil for the culture of
new and queer religions. But on the whole,&mdash;yes,
in immensely the larger proportion,&mdash;the old reli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>gion
prevails, and a rather simple and primitive
type of Christianity keeps its hold upon the hearts
and minds of the majority. The consequence of
this is (to quote again from Professor M&uuml;nsterberg,
lest you should think me a prejudiced reporter),
that &ldquo;however many sins there are, the life of the
people is intrinsically pure, moral, and devout.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The number of those who live above the general
level of moral requirement is astonishingly large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now this habit of soul, this tone of life, is reflected
in American literature. Whatever defects it may
have, a lack of serious feeling and purpose is not
among them. It is pervaded, generally, by the spiritual
preconception. It approaches life from the
point of view of responsibility. It gives full value
to those instincts, desires, and hopes in man which
have to do with the unseen world.</p>

<p>Even in those writers who are moved by a sense
of revolt against the darkness and severity of certain
theological creeds, the attempt is not to escape from
religion, but to find a clearer, nobler, and more loving
expression of religion. Even in those works
which deal with subjects which are non-religious in
their specific quality,&mdash;stories of adventure, like
Cooper&rsquo;s novels; poems of romance, like the ballads
of Longfellow and Whittier,&mdash;one feels the
implication of a spiritual background, a moral law,
a Divine providence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>This, hitherto, has been the characteristic note of
the literature of America. It has taken for granted
that there is a God, that men must answer to Him
for their actions, and that one of the most interesting
things about people, even in books, is their moral
quality.</p>

<p>(2) Another trait which seems to me strongly
marked in the American temperament and clearly
reflected in American literature is the love of nature.
The attractions of the big out-of-doors have taken
hold upon the people. They feel a strong affection
for their great, free, untended forests, their swift-rushing
rivers, their bright, friendly brooks, their
wooded mountain ranges of the East, their snowy
peaks and vast plains and many-coloured canyons
of the West.</p>

<p>I suppose there is no other country in the world
where so many people break away from the fatigues
of civilization every year, and go out to live in the
open for a vacation with nature. The business of
making tents and camp outfits for these voluntary
gypsies has grown to be enormous. In California
they do not even ask for a tent. They sleep <i>&agrave; la
belle &eacute;toile</i>.</p>

<p>The Audubon societies have spread to every
State. You will not find anywhere in Europe, ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>cept
perhaps in Switzerland, such companies of boys
and girls studying the wild flowers and the birds.
The interest is not altogether, nor mainly, scientific.
It is vital and temperamental. It is the expression
of an inborn sympathy with nature and a real delight
in her works.</p>

<p>This has found an utterance in the large and
growing &ldquo;nature-literature&rdquo; of America. John
James Audubon, Henry Thoreau, John Burroughs,
Clarence King, John Muir, Ernest Seton, Frank
Chapman, Ernest Ingersoll,&mdash;these are some of
the men who have not only carefully described, but
also lovingly interpreted, &ldquo;nature in her visible
forms,&rdquo; and so have given to their books, beyond the
value of accurate records of observation, the charm
of sympathetic and illuminative writing.</p>

<p>But it is not only in these special books that I
would look for evidence of the love of nature in the
American temperament. It is found all through the
poetry and the prose of the best writers. The most
perfect bit of writing in the works of that stern Calvinist,
Jonathan Edwards, is the description of an
early morning walk through a field of wild flowers.
Some of the best pages of Irving and Cooper are
sketches of landscape along the Hudson River.
The scenery of New England is drawn with infinite
delicacy and skill in the poetry of Bryant, Whittier,
and Emerson. Bret Harte and Joaquin Miller make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
as see the painted desert and the ragged Sierras.
James Lane Allen shows us the hemp fields of
Kentucky, George Cable the bayous of Louisiana.
But the list of illustrations is endless. The whole
literature of America is filled with pictures of nature.
There is hardly a familiar bird or flower for which
some poet has not tried to find a distinct, personal,
significant expression in his verse.</p>

<p>(3) A third trait of the American temperament
is the sense of humour. This is famous, not to say
notorious. The Americans are supposed to be a
nation of jokers, whose daily jests, like their ready-made
shoes, have a peculiar oblique form which
makes it slightly difficult for people of other nationalities
to get into them.</p>

<p>There may be some truth in the latter part of this
supposition, for I have frequently observed that a
remark which seemed to me very amusing only puzzled
a foreigner. For example, a few years ago, when
Mark Twain was in Europe, a despatch appeared in
some of the American newspapers giving an account
of his sudden death. Knowing that this would
trouble his friends, and being quite well, he sent a
cablegram in these words, &ldquo;Report of my death
grossly exaggerated, Mark Twain.&rdquo; When I repeated
this to an Englishman, he looked at me pityingly
and said: &ldquo;But how could you exaggerate a
thing like that, my dear fellow? Either he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
dead, or he was alive, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo; This
was perfectly incontestable, and the statement of it
represented the English point of view.</p>

<p>But to the American incontestable things often
have a double aspect: first that of the solemn fact;
and then that of the curious, unreal, pretentious
shape in which it is dressed by fashion, or vanity,
or stupid respectability. In this region of incongruities
created by the contrast between things as they
really are and the way in which dull or self-important
people usually talk about them, American humour
plays.</p>

<p>It is not irreverent toward the realities. But for
the conventionalities, the absurdities, the pomposities
of life, it has a habit of friendly satire and good-tempered
raillery. It is not like the French wit,
brilliant and pointed. It is not like the English fun,
in which practical joking plays so large a part. It
is not like the German joke, which announces its
arrival with the sound of a trumpet. It usually wears
rather a sober face and speaks with a quiet voice.
It delights in exposing pretensions by gravely carrying
them to the point of wild extravagance. It finds
its material in subjects which are laughable, but not
odious; and in people who are ridiculous, but not
hateful.</p>

<p>Its favourite method is to exaggerate the foibles
of persons who are excessive in certain directions, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
to make a statement absurd simply by taking it
literally. Thus a Yankee humorist said of a certain
old lady that she was so inquisitive that she put her
head out of all the front windows of the house at the
same time. A Westerner claimed the prize of inventiveness
for his town on the ground that one of its
citizens had taught his ducks to swim on hot water
in order that they might lay boiled eggs. Mr. Dooley
described the book in which President Roosevelt gave
his personal reminiscences of the Spanish-American
War under the title &ldquo;<i>Alone in Cubea</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once, when I was hunting in the Bad Lands of
North Dakota, and had lost my way, I met a solitary
horseman in the desert and said to him, &ldquo;I
want to go to the Cannonball River.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,
stranger,&rdquo; he answered, looking at me with a solemn
air of friendly interest, &ldquo;I guess ye can go if ye want
to; there ain&rsquo;t no string on ye.&rdquo; But when I laughed
and said what I really wanted was that he should
show me the way, he replied, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t ye say
so?&rdquo; and rode with me until we struck the trail to
camp.</p>

<p>All this is typical of native American humour,
quaint, good-natured, sober-faced, and extravagant.
At bottom it is based upon the democratic
assumption that the artificial distinctions and conventional
phrases of life are in themselves amusing.
It flavours the talk of the street and the dinner-table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
It makes the Americans inclined to prefer farce to
melodrama, comedietta to grand opera. In its
extreme and degenerate form it drifts into habitual
buffoonery, like the crude, continuous jests of the
comic supplements to the Sunday newspapers. In
its better shape it relieves the strenuousness and the
monotony of life by a free and kindly touch upon its
incongruities, just as a traveller on a serious errand
makes the time pass by laughing at his own mishaps
and at the queer people whom he meets by the way.</p>

<p>You will find it in literature in all forms: in
books of the professional humorists from Artemus
Ward to Mr. Dooley: in books of <i>genre</i> painting,
like Mark Twain&rsquo;s <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> and
<i>Pudd&rsquo;nhead Wilson</i>, or like <i>David Harum</i>,
which owed its immense popularity to the lifelike
portrait of an old horse trader in a rural town of
central New York: in books of sober purpose, like
the essays of Lowell or Emerson, where a sudden
smile flashes out at you from the gravest page.
Oliver Wendell Holmes shows it to you, in <i>The
Autocrat of the Breakfast Table</i>, dressed in the
proper garb of Boston; you may recognize it on
horseback among the cowboys, in the stories of
Owen Wister and O. Henry; it talks the Mississippi
River dialect in the admirable pages of
Charles D. Stewart&rsquo;s <i>Partners with Providence</i>, and
speaks with the local accent of Louisville, Ken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>tucky,
in <i>Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch</i>. Almost
everywhere you will find the same general tone,
a compound of mock gravity, exaggeration, good
nature, and inward laughter.</p>

<p>You may catch the spirit of it all in a letter that
Benjamin Franklin sent to a London newspaper in
1765. He was having a little fun with English editors
who had been printing wild articles about
America. &ldquo;All this,&rdquo; wrote he, &ldquo;is as certainly true
as the account, said to be from Quebec, in all the
papers of last week, that the inhabitants of Canada
are making preparations for a cod and whale fishery
this summer in the upper Lakes. Ignorant people
may object that the upper Lakes are fresh, and that
cod and whales are salt-water fish; but let them know,
Sir, that cod, like other fish, when attacked by their
enemies, fly into any water where they can be safest;
that whales, when they have a mind to eat cod, pursue
them wherever they fly; and that the grand leap
of the whale in the chase up the Falls of Niagara is
esteemed, by those who have seen it, as one of the
finest spectacles in Nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(4) The last trait of the American temperament
on which I wish touch briefly is the sentiment of
humanity.</p>

<p>It is not an unkind country, this big republic,
where the manners are so &ldquo;free and easy,&rdquo; the
<i>tempo</i> of life so quick, the pressure of business so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
heavy and continuous. The feeling of philanthropy
in its broader sense,&mdash;the impulse which makes men
inclined to help one another, to sympathize with the
unfortunate, to lift a neighbour or a stranger out of
a tight place,&mdash;good will, in short,&mdash;is in the blood
of the people.</p>

<p>When their blood is heated, they are hard hitters,
fierce fighters. But give them time to cool down,
and they are generous peacemakers. Abraham
Lincoln&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;With malice toward none, with
charity for all,&rdquo; strikes the key-note. In the &ldquo;mild
concerns of ordinary life&rdquo; they like to cultivate
friendly relations, to show neighbourliness, to do
the useful thing.</p>

<p>There is a curious word of approbation in the
rural dialect of Pennsylvania. When the country
folk wish to express their liking for a man, they say,
&ldquo;He is a very common person,&rdquo;&mdash;meaning not that
he is low or vulgar, but approachable, sympathetic,
kind to all.</p>

<p>Underneath the surface of American life, often
rough and careless, there lies this widespread feeling:
that human nature everywhere is made of the same
stuff; that life&rsquo;s joys and sorrows are felt in the same
way whether they are hidden under homespun and
calico or under silk and broadcloth; that it is every
man&rsquo;s duty to do good and not evil to those who live
in the world with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>In literature this feeling has shown itself in many
ways. It has given a general tone of sympathy with
&ldquo;the under dog in a fight.&rdquo; It has led writers to
look for subjects among the plain people. It has
made the novel of American &ldquo;high life&rdquo; incline
generally to satire or direct rebuke. In the typical
American romance the hero is seldom rich, the villain
seldom poor.</p>

<p>In the weaker writers the humane sentiment
dwindles into sentimentality. In the stronger writers
it gives, sometimes, a very noble and manly note.
In general you may say that it has impressed upon
American literature the mark of a moral purpose,&mdash;the
wish to elevate, to purify, to fortify the mind,
and so the life, of those who read.</p>

<p>Is this a merit or a fault in literature? Judge
for yourselves.</p>

<p>No doubt a supremely ethical intention is an insufficient
outfit for an author. His work may be</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">&ldquo;Chaste as the icicle</span><br />
That&rsquo;s curded by the frost from purest snow<br />
And hangs on Dian&rsquo;s temple,&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">and yet it may be without savour or permanence.
Often the desire to teach a good lesson bends a book
from the straight line of truth-to-the-facts, and makes
a so-called virtuous ending at the price of sincerity
and thoroughgoing honesty.</p>

<p>It is not profitable to real virtue to dwell in a world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
of fiction where miracles are worked to crown the
good and proper folk with unvarying felicity and
to send all the rascals to prison or a miserable grave.
Nor is it a wise and useful thing for literature to
ignore the lower side of life for the sake of commending
the higher; to speak a false and timid
language for fear of shocking the sensitive; to evade
the actual problems and conflicts which men and
women of flesh and blood have to meet, for the sake
of creating a perfectly respectable atmosphere for
the imagination to live in.</p>

<p>This mistaking of prudery for decency, this unwillingness
to deal quite frankly with life as it is,
has perhaps acted with a narrowing and weakening
effect upon the course of American literature in the
past. But just now there seems to be a reaction
toward the other extreme. Among certain English
and American writers, especially of the female sex,
there is a new fashion of indiscriminate candour
which would make Balzac blush. But I suppose
that this will pass, since every extreme carries within
itself the seed of disintegration.</p>

<p>The <i>morale</i> of literature, after all, does not lie
outside of the great circle of ethics. It is a simple
application of the laws which embrace the whole of
human life to the specific business of a writer.</p>

<p>To speak the truth; to respect himself and his
readers; to do justly and to love mercy; to deal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
with language as a living thing of secret and incalculable
power; not to call good, evil, or evil, good;
to honour the noble and to condemn the base; to
face the facts of life with courage, the humours of
life with sympathy, and the mysteries of life with
reverence; and to perform his task of writing as
carefully, as lovingly, as well as he can,&mdash;this, it
seems to me, is the whole duty of an author.</p>

<p>This, if I mistake not, has been the effort of the
chief writers of America. They have spoken surely
to the heart of a great people. They have kept the
fine ideals of the past alive in the conflicts of the
present. They have lightened the labours of a
weary day. They have left their readers a little happier,
perhaps a little wiser, certainly a little stronger
and braver, for the battle and the work of life.</p>

<p>The measure of their contribution to the small
group of world-books, the literature that is universal
in meaning and enduring in form, must be left for
the future to determine. But it is sure already that
American literature has done much to express and
to perpetuate the Spirit of America.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="smcap">President J. G. Schurman of Cornell University</span> writes of this
book: &ldquo;I regard Mr. Croly&rsquo;s book as a serious and weighty contribution
to contemporary American politics. A treatise on the fundamental
political ideas of the American people which attempts to develop their
full content and to re-read American history in the light of these developed
ideas cannot, of course, be made light literature; but the author
brings to the weighty subject with which he deals a lucid and vivacious
style and a logical sense of arrangement. And thoughtful readers who
are interested in fundamental political principles, once they have started
the book, are pretty certain to finish it.... For my own part I have
found the book exceedingly stimulating. It is also instructive, for the
author seems to be thoroughly versed in the modern political and economic
history not only of America but of Europe as well. Finally, the
volume has the immense attraction of dealing with a subject which of
all political subjects is now most prominent in the mind not only of
thoughtful citizens, but, one might almost say, of the American people.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="blockquot">&ldquo;&lsquo;The Promise of American Life&rsquo; will beyond doubt be recognized by
students of the great philosophical currents of American history and
political development as an unusual and remarkable work.... Mr.
Croly acutely analyzes American democracy and pseudo-democracy,
while his treatment of the actual present tendencies of democratic ideals
is even more instructive and suggestive than the purely historical part
of his book. He writes with a free pen and is both apt and keen-witted
in his way of illustrating theories and beliefs by practical applications.
One chapter, for instance, which will attract very special attention is that
which considers the aims and methods of four typical reformers, Jerome,
Hearst, Bryan, and Roosevelt.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Outlook.</i></p>
